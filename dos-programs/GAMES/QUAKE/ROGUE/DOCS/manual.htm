<h3><a name="The Story"><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>The
Story</strong></font></a></h3>

<p><font size="2">You're alive, and aware, and in one piece.
&quot;Thank God for simple favors,&quot; but... &quot;What in
Hell happened?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ages ago you defeated Armagon; yet it seems as
if it happened in the last instant. The Rift Portal was sealed
and the slipgate effect deposited you back at HQ.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Command is quiet--too damn quiet! You exit
Command Central to scan the dimly lit corridor beyond.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Sprawled face down in a stagnant mire, is a...
Grunt? An Enforcer? Who could tell; what's left of him is
mangled! His backpack has emptied into the red-tinged muck. Among
the spattered effects are the bent leather covers of a charred
book, its bindings tooled with a familiar symbol. &quot;No...
that wasn't there before!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Ripped from the text and floating in the muck,
a particular leaf of stained parchment stabs for your attention.
In a perfect hand-hewn typeface the passage reads:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p align="center"><font size="4"><em><strong>The Book of
    Common Prayer</strong></em></font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="2"><em>Let it be known that in that moment
        our Master brought forth, from the void of order and
        light, a new existence of glorious darkness. His mighty
        hands fashioned this world of chaos, violence and pain.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><em>Our past, our present and our
        future are moulded by the seeds that He has sewn. Through
        His wisdom He has given us Ancient Guardians to tend the
        Chain of Time. Their suffering is our link and lineage
        throughout all time and forever.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><em>In honoured service we come before
        Him to pay our age-old debt. We whisper this humble
        prayer with the knowledge that He will hear our thanks
        for what He has brought to pass.</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2"><em>Oh Master Quake, we kneel before
        the Mark, upon this day, this hour, and this moment, to
        proclaim your dominion and celebrate The Day of
        Dissolution.</em></font></p>
        <p align="right"><font size="2"><em>Day 57, 1215 A.Q.</em></font></p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="2">&quot;GOD FRIGGING DAMN! This can't be
happening!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2">You scramble across the body for the shotgun,
dragging the remnants of the backpack behind. At the end of the
darkened passage a slipgate comes into focus.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">One thought becomes your obsession as you step
onto the slipgate platform: &quot;THIS TIME IT WILL END!&quot;</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Quake Mission Pack No. 2 (The
Dissolution of Eternity) requires the full, registered version of
Quake to run. For installation instructions on Quake, refer to
the </font><a href="README.txt"><font color="#000000" size="2">README.TXT</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2"> on the Quake CD to see the exact
procedure recommended for your machine. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Once Quake has been installed,
you can install Quake Mission Pack No. 2. For detailed
installation instructions, refer to the </font><a

<p><font size="2">As with Quake, this Mission Pack offers a
variety of play options. The options below can be entered at a
DOS prompt, although each option below is installed either as a
Shortcut in your Start Menu if you installed the Mission Pack
through Windows 95 or as a *.bat file if you installed through
DOS.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Note: You must change to the directory where
Quake is installed (i.e., c:\quake), then from the command prompt
run the following commands. </font></p>

<blockquote>

<p><a name="THE BASICS OF PLAY"><font color="#000000" size="5"><strong>THE
BASICS OF PLAY</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Goal of the Game</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="1">Each level ends with a distinctive door or exit
to the next level. Unlike Quake, however, </font><font size="1"
face="CO Univers 57 CondOblique">Quake Mission Pack No. 2</font><font
size="1"> is played in a linear fashion, taking you through each
of the two episodes (15 levels) leading you to discover the
ultimate depths of Quake's evil scheme in the final
level&#151;Source of Evil.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Skill</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The Start Level has several
different slipgates for each level of Skill you wish to play. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Easy</strong>: This is
meant for little kids and grandmas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Medium</strong>: Most
people should start Quake at Medium skill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Hard</strong>: Here at
id Software, we play Hard skill, and we think you should too, if
you can handle it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Nightmare</strong>:
Good luck.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Getting About</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Walk</strong>: Use the
arrow keys or the mouse. To walk steadily forward, hold down the
Forward key (up arrow or right mouse button). Turn left or right
with the left or right arrow key, or by sliding your mouse in the
desired direction. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Run</strong>: Hold down
the shift key to increase your speed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Jumping</strong>: Tap
the space bar or the Enter key to jump. You jump further if
you're moving forward at the time, and you jump higher if you're
moving up a slope at the time. You'll be surprised at the spots
you can reach in a jump. You can even avoid some attacks this
way. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Swimming</strong>: When
underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go, and
press the forward key to go in that direction. You have full
three-dimensional freedom. Unfortunately, as in real life, you
may lose your bearings while underwater. Use jump (the space bar
or Enter key) to kick straight up towards the surface.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Once on the surface, tread
water by holding down jump. To get out of the drink, swim towards
the shore. Once there, use jump to clamber up. If you're down a
well or you can't get a grip, you may not be able to climb out.
There is always another way out, but you may have to submerge to
find it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Shooting</strong>: Tap
the Ctrl key or the left mouse button to fire. Hold shoot down to
keep firing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Use</strong>: Quake has
no 'use' function. To push a button or open a door, walk up to it
or, in some cases, shoot it. To ride a platform up, step onto it.
If a door won't open or a platform won't lower, you may need to
do something special to activate it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Picking up stuff: </strong>To
pick up items, weapons, and power-ups, walk over them. If you
can't pick up something, it means you already have the maximum
possible. If it is armor, it means the stuff you're trying to get
is worse than what you now have. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Finding Things</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Buttons and
Floorplates: </strong>Buttons activate with a touch, and
floorplates must be stepped on. If you see a distinctive-looking
button in a spot you cannot reach, it's probably a shootable
button - fire at it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Doors</strong>: Most
doors open at your approach. If one doesn't, seek a button,
floorplate, or key.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Secret Doors: </strong>Some
doors are camouflaged. Almost all secret doors open when they are
shot or hit with an axe. The rest are opened by hidden pressure
plates or buttons. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Platforms</strong>:
Most platforms only go up and down, while some follow tracks
around rooms or levels. Normally, when you step onto a platform,
it rises to its full height, and lowers when you step off. Some
platforms drop when you step onto them, and some don't work until
you activate them via button or pressure plate. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Pressure Plates &amp;
Motion Detectors: </strong>Invisible or visible sensors can open
doors, unleash traps, warn monsters, etc. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Uncovering Secrets: </strong>Secrets
are hidden in many ways. You might need to shoot a button, kill a
monster, walk through a secret motion detector, etc. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>The Secret of Secrets: </strong>All
secrets in Quake Mission Pack No. 2 are indicated by clues. Don't
waste your time hacking at every wall. It's much more productive
(and fun) to use your brain and your eyes. Look up. An angled
texture, a light shining under a wall, a strange
sound...anything...might be the clue. Something prominent in a
room might be decoration...or it might be the clue.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: Bouncing
a grenade off a shootable button or secret door won't open it,
but if the grenade's explosion goes off nearby, this may well
activate such secrets. </font></p>

explains all. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: Quake
Mission Pack No. 2 saves your current key configuration when you
quit, so that next time you play, you have the same
configuration. </font></p>

down, a single player game is paused. A wide variety of esoteric

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>The Screen</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The large top part of the
screen is the view area, in which you see monsters and
architecture. Immediately below is the Inventory Bar. Below that
is the Status Bar. You can enlarge the viewing area (tap the +
key), so much that it engulfs first the Inventory Bar and then
the Status Bar. The '-' key shrinks the view area.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Inventory Bar</strong>:
Lists ammo, weapons, deathmatch scores, and power-ups.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The active weapon is lit up.
Each weapon has a number by it--type the appropriate number key
to switch to that weapon. In deathmatch, the top four scores are
displayed, along with the color(s) of those players.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Status Bar</strong>: A
vital part of the screen. When your armor, hit points, or ammo
gets low, the number turns red. That's a hint, pal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">While in Multiplayer Mode,
pressing TAB shows the normal stuff you would see in
Single-player Mode, but over the game screen the entire Rankings
List will be displayed (just like when you die in Deathmatch
Mode).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Score Bar</strong>:
Hold down the Tab key to replace the Status Bar with the Score
Bar. This lists the proportion of monsters you've killed, secrets
you've found, and time you've spent, along with the level name.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Messages</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Quake talks to you from time to
time. Some messages appear at the top of the screen. These are
non-critical, and tell you that you've picked up an object, or
you've died in an interesting fashion. Ignore these messages if
you please.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Certain messages appear in the
middle of your view area. These are always important, and you do
not want to ignore them!</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Ending a Level</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="1">At the end of Episode One/Hell's Fortress, you
will find a slipgate. Climb onto the gate platform to pass
through to the next episode. You will notice, unfortunately,
after you 'materialize' in Episode Two/The Corridors of Time,
that you are stripped of the armor and weapons you had acquired
to this point. &quot;Quake is aware of your victory, and wishes
to even the odds.&quot; </font></p>

NEW ENVIRONMENT</font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>New Weapons in Quake
Mission Pack No. 2 (Dissolution of Eternity)</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Lava Nails: </b>Lava nails are armor
piercing 'hot shots' from the Nailgun. They inflict more damage
than regular nails. They're something to be avoided! A small box
equals five nails.</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Multi Grenades: </b>These 'split off' into
five distinct grenades for an increased damage radius. The
explosive effect is... stunning! A small box equals five
grenades.</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Multi Rockets: </b>These fire as one rocket,
then 'split' into four to locate separate targets. A small box
equals five rockets.</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Plasma Cells: </b>We've 'beefed up' the
Thunderbolt to fire a plasma energy ball. The shot 'grounds out'
on target, impacting with powerful tendrils of lightning. This
alternate mode is great for recon! A small box equals six
charges.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Switching Between
Weapons</strong>: If you are firing a weapon and run out of ammo,
Quake automatically switches you to another weapon. It will never
switch to the grenade launcher or rocket launcher, however, for
reasons that ought to be obvious. So if you're firing away
happily and suddenly switch to the axe, it doesn't mean you're
out of ammo--you probably still have grenades. But Quake requires
you to switch to these dangerous explosives on your own.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>New Powerups in Quake
Mission Pack No. 2</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Anti Grav Belt: </b>The theory is simple
here; it counters the force of gravity and allows the player to
make difficult jumps.</font></p>

<p><font size="1"><b>Power Shield: </b>This 'little gem'
significantly decreases the damage you receive from most enemy
attacks. In Deathmatch, try out the RAM attack to send your
opponents flying.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>New Creatures in Quake
Mission Pack No. 2</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Phantom Swordsmen: </b>A
disembodied spectral sword that will slash the player at many
turns.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Electric Eels: </b>These
little guys are power-packed and more menacing than the Rotfish.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Statues:</b> They're
'poised' to take you out.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Hell Spawn: </b>A
deadly upgrade to Quake's spawn.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Multi-Grenade Ogres:</b>
Turnabout is fair-play; at least for the Ogres, that is.
Occasionally you will find that these guys can toss a Multi
Grenade at you, too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Wrath:</b> These are
the Overlord's evil minions. Smaller, but just as deadly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Overlord:</b> This
robed skeletal figure ominously floats with the environment. His
attack? A ball of energy which tracks the player and detonates on
impact.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Guardians:</b>
Stationed in the past to execute Quake's evil plan. These
demi-gods' 'surprising' entrance will shock you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>A Surprising End Game
Boss:</b> Everyone's been screaming for this enemy. He'll have
you screaming too!</font></p>

Hazards and Effects in Quake Mission Pack No. 2: </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Pendulums:</b>
They're set to slice the player to shreds... when they least
expect it!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Lightning Shooters:</b>
Well, these shoot lightning and can be directed at any angle.
Sizzle!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Lava Nail Shooters: </b>Let's
see... these shoot Lava Nails. Need we say more?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Buzz Saws: </b>Compact.
Cordless. And... completely gib-o-matic. Watch out!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Earthquakes: </b>Level
areas that tremble with seismic activity. Now the player can
literally... quake!</font></p>

<p><a name="MULTIPLAYER ACTION"><font color="#000000" size="5">MULTIPLAYER
ACTION</font></a></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Quake Mission Pack No. 2
(The Dissolution of Eternity) fully supports multiplayer mode.
There is one new level designed specifically for multiplayer. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When you are using the
console or Main Menu in multiplayer, the game does not pause.
Irresponsible players and monsters can freely shoot you, and your
only recourse is bloodthirsty vengeance. The Talk function is
useful here. When you talk, the message appears at the top of all
players' screens, preceded by the speaker's name. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">To set up, run, or join
a multiplayer game, use the Main Menu Multiplayer option.
README.TXT contains details that may be useful if your network or
modem needs special configurations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Cooperative</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In a co-op game, you and
your friends work together to finish the level. When one person
exits, everyone else exits too, wherever they might be. If you
are killed in co-op, you reappear at the start area, and have to
catch up to your buddies. Use Talk to find out where they are.
See the Multiplayer options on the Main Menu for more info. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>Deathmatch</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In a deathmatch, play is
totally cutthroat. No monsters exist, and when you are killed,
you reappear in a random spot. After you pick up an item, it
respawns (i.e. pops back into existence) after a while. (Some
items take longer to respawn than others.) Every time you kill
someone, you get a Frag. The person with the most Frags wins, so
wreak slaughter amongst your pals!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">If you kill yourself,
whether intentionally or by accident, you lose a Frag. This
includes drowning, getting crushed, and so forth. See the
Multiplayer options on the Main Menu for more info.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>New Team Games in Mission Pack No. 2</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Team play is a cool
combination of co-op and deathmatch. As players join the game,
the computer places them on teams, with different color uniforms.
The team with the most Frags wins. See MANUAL.TXT for details.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Tag: </b>It's the
game you played as a kid, with a few changes, such as--weapons of
mass destruction! Grab the Tag Token and you will be rewarded
with three Frags for every 'kill.' Do that five times; you get
the Quad Damage.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Capture the Flag
(CTF): </b>Capture the enemy flag, then take it back and touch
your flag at your own base. Sounds simple, huh? It's a load of
fun! This is the most exciting variation for normal Deathmatch to
date. For more information, see the CTF document.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>One Flag: </b>This is
a variation on regular CTF. Two teams, one flag; in an all out
slaughter-fest! Find the flag, grab the flag; head for the enemy
base.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Three Team: </b>This
CTF variation adds a third team into the mix. The Grey Team can
grab either team's flag, but they must take it to the opposite
flag/team base to score. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4"><b>New Multiplayer Features in Mission Pack No.
2</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Vengeance Sphere: </b>What
can we say? It's ultimate retribution--from the grave!</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Random Powerup
Respawn:</b> No more campers! Well... at least your opponent
won't get the Quad Damage every time it &quot;pops up&quot; in
Deathmatch. We call Random Respawn the Great Equalizer.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>Grappling Hook:</b>
This is an added feature to CTF. To use it, press the 1 key
twice, then fire the Hook at a wall or ceiling. Continue to hold
down the fire key... and you'll be pulled toward the 'grappled'
location.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>Q: </strong></font><font
size="1" face="New York,Times New Roman">The Dissolution of
Eternity is challenging! Are you guys targeting the pack to
sado-masochists?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>A: </strong></font><font
size="1" face="New York,Times New Roman">No, although we don't
discriminate. We believe that an expansion pack that builds upon
the Quake universe should have more difficult gameplay than the
original game.</font></p>

size="3" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong> </strong></font><font
size="1" face="New York,Times New Roman">Cool, you make computer
games! So... do you guys just sit around and play games all day?</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>A:</strong></font><font
size="3" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong> </strong></font><font
size="1" face="New York,Times New Roman">Well... certainly it is
an exciting experience with a flexible schedule in the ultimate
TEAM environment! But it's not all fun and... err... games. This
career requires a lot of hard work, determination, and focus. To
get games onto the retail shelves takes a miraculous, and
sometimes indefinable, chain of events. Still, we can't think of
anything we'd rather do with our time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>Q: </strong></font><font

<p><font size="3" face="New York,Times New Roman"><strong>A: </strong></font><font
size="1" face="New York,Times New Roman">There's an ancient
software proverb that says: &quot;Time spent talking about game
ideas takes away from actually making the game.&quot; We have
