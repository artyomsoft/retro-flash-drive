<p><font size="5"><b>Capture the Flag</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Capture the Flag (CTF) offers an exciting
variation on team play. It gives meaning to base defense along
with offensive positioning and strikes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">The basic premise is: attack the enemy base,
grab their flag, and take it back to your base. </font></p>

<p><font size="2">Mission Pack No. 2 offers three variations to
CTF: normal, one flag, and three team. This document gives a
general overview to each type of play. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b><i>PLEASE NOTE: </i></b>It is possible to
select multiplayer combinations in the Mission Pack No. 2
front-end, such as Co-operative Tag, that cannot be played.
Although an interesting &quot;unsupported feature,&quot; it can
be confusing to be in Tag mode with Co-operative play options and
monsters. If you find yourself in a CTF game with monsters, you
should restart the level with teamplay set to &quot;no
teamplay.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>CTF: Normal</b></font></p>

<ol>
    <li><font size="2">Two areas of the map are designated as
        base encampments.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">When you join the game, you are assigned
        to a team. Depending on the configuration of the server,
        you may change teams; if you are allowed to change, you
        will lose your frag count when changing. You are spawned
        at your team's base. If you die, you are not spawned at
        the base, but at one of the deathmatch start spots. This
        way, you don't kill a guy defending his flag at the enemy
        base and he comes back to life immediately in the same
        spot.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">The flags are based on the medieval key
        models. If you pick up the enemy flag, you must return to
        base and touch your flag in order to score. Note that if
        you get back to the base, your flag might not be there if
        the other team has it! Get the rest of your team to go
        frag the enemy player and get your flag back!</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">When a player carrying the enemy flag
        touches his own flag, he will complete a successful
        capture. He gets a bonus of 15 points. Everyone else on
        his team gets 10 points.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">If you kill an opposing team player who
        has your flag, he drops it, and you also get 2 points. If
        you touch your flag, it will teleport back to your base.
        You also get one point as a recovery bonus. This gives
        base defenders a reward for guarding their flag.
        Defending the flag carrier (your teammate) from an attack
        counts as an assist worth 3 points, and returning it to
        base garners you an extra point.</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">Since everyone starts at their base after
        each level change (or upon joining the game), the team
        will have to work out who is going to go offensive and
        try to get the enemy flag, and who will play defense by
        staying at base and guarding the flag. Yes , this is
        camping, but it is camping with a cause!</font></li>
    <li><font size="2">You can communicate with teammates by
        binding &quot;messagemode2&quot; to a key.</font></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>CTF: One Flag</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">Both the Red and the Blue teams will start in
their base camps. Neither team will have a flag at their camp.
The flag starts out in a designated &quot;one flag&quot; start
spot on the map. Both teams must then try and reach the flag
before their opponents. Once they gain control of the flag, the
object is not to return to your own camp, but to the OTHER team's
base camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Scoring: All of the regular rules for CTF would
apply. The points awarded for the flag capture, killing opposing
team members, dispatching threats to your flag carrier, and the
rest would apply.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>CTF: Three Team</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">There will be three teams at spawn time: the
two normal Red and Blue teams, as well as a third Grey team. The
Blue and Red teams initially spawn at their normal base sites;
the members of the Grey team will spawn in random deathmatch
start locations.</font></p>

<p><font size="2">Scoring: The rules for teams Red and Blue stay
exactly the same. Grey team members can pick up either color flag
and must run it to the <u>other</u> color&#146;s base camp to
score. The rest of the scoring rules still apply to the Grey
team, but the points are halved to compensate for the ability to
grab either flag. The other scoring works the same. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="2"><b>The Grappling Hook</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2">In CTF games, toggling the &quot;1&quot; key
will switch your axe to an enhanced grappling hook created
especially for Quake Mission Pack No. 2. The grappling hook is an
integral part of Capture the Flag and, when used strategically,
can be a powerful aid. To use the hook, fire as you would any
other weapon but hold the fire key down. The hook will launch and
attach itself to a wall or another object. When you hold down the
fire key, the grappling hook will pull you along. </font></p>

<p><font size="2"><b>One more thing&#133;</b></font></p>
