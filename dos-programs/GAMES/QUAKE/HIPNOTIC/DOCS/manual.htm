<h3><a name="The Story"><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>The
Story</strong></font></a></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The blood of Shub-Niggurath
lingers in the air like a heavy mist. Chunks of putrid flesh lie
in piles throughout the subterranean cavern. Exhausted, you
stumble along, searching for an exit from this hellhole. You find
a blood-spattered slipgate; a strange juxtaposition of
ultra-technology and medieval squalor. Hoping for either paradise
or oblivion, you step through the slipgate, gambling on its
unknown destination.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">In a flash of light and pain
you emerge from the slipgate's quantum vortex in the shiny-clean
environment of a modern military base...your home away from home.
Leaving bloody footprints in your wake, you step away from the
slipgate like a man emerging from a car wreck.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Wearily, you look for some
semblance of the life and sanity that you remember from the time
before you heard the name &quot;Quake&quot;, but find only
emptiness. Despite your recent hellish experience, the strange
quiet of the military base is more unsettling than comforting. In
fact, it's not just shellshock that makes it seem quiet, it's the
absolute absence of any life in a place that should be bustling
with military activity. Readying your trusty shotgun, you begin a
stealthy surveillance.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The hum of a nearby computer
terminal catches your attention. Peering closely at the glowing
screen, you read the final orders from the base commander:
&quot;Quake's forces have infiltrated the weapons storage
facility and are receiving reinforcements through slipgates
located at the research center. All personnel are ordered to
proceed with evacuation procedure EVAC-44A.&quot; Your heart
sinks as you realize that the commander has ordered the base to
be sealed to prevent Quake's forces from infiltrating further
into our realm. All weapons and vehicles have been removed to
reduce any military advantage that could be gained by taking the
base. Any means of escaping or defending yourself are gone.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">With the loss of hope comes
resolution. Gritting your teeth, you decide that you can either
cower here, waiting for Quake's forces to arrive, or you can take
the battle to them, infiltrate the storage facility and take out
as many of the bastards as you can. If you were the cowering
type, you wouldn't have survived as long as you have. Who knows,
maybe you can find some way of destroying the portal that allows
Quake to perpetually send reinforcements.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">You go to the slipgate that
leads to the weapons facility. Monitors show that the site has
already been overrun with the twisted soldiers that follow Quake.
Hopefully, they won't be expecting the likes of you. Gripping
your shotgun with both hands, you leap into the gate...Valhalla
awaits!</font></p>

<h3><a name="Installation"><font color="#000000" size="4">Installation</font></a></h3>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Quake Mission Pack #1 (The
Scourge of Armagon) requires the full, registered version of
Quake to run. For installation instructions on Quake, refer to
the </font><a href="README.txt"><font color="#000000" size="2">README.TXT</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2"> on the Quake CD to see the exact
procedure recommended for your machine. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Once Quake has been installed,
you can install Quake Mission Pack #1. For detailed installation
instructions, refer to the </font><a href="README.txt"><font
color="#000000" size="2">README.TXT</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2"> on the Quake Mission Pack #1 CD. You
must install Quake Mission Pack #1 before you can play it. It
will not run off the CD-ROM.</font></p>

<p><a name="THE BASICS OF PLAY"><font color="#000000" size="5"><strong>THE
BASICS OF PLAY</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Goal of the Game</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Just like Quake, Quake Mission
Pack #1 has two basic goals. First, stay alive. Second, get out
of the place you're in. Each level ends in a slipgate; these
signify that you've entered another dimension. Unlike Quake,
however, Quake Mission Pack #1 is played in a linear fashion,
taking you through each of the fifteen levels ultimately leading
you to the Boss, Armagon, in the final showdown.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Skill</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The Start Level has several
different slipgates for each level of Skill you wish to play. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Easy</strong>: This is
meant for little kids and grandmas.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Medium</strong>: Most
people should start Quake at Medium skill.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Hard</strong>: Here at
id Software, we play Hard skill, and we think you should too, if
you can handle it.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Nightmare</strong>:
Good luck.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Getting About</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Walk</strong>: Use the
arrow keys or the mouse. To walk steadily forward, hold down the
Forward key (up arrow or right mouse button). Turn left or right
with the left or right arrow key, or by sliding your mouse in the
desired direction. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Run</strong>: Hold down
the shift key to increase your speed. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Jumping</strong>: Tap
the space bar or the Enter key to jump. You jump further if
you're moving forward at the time, and you jump higher if you're
moving up a slope at the time. You'll be surprised at the spots
you can reach in a jump. You can even avoid some attacks this
way. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Swimming</strong>: When
underwater, aim yourself in the direction you wish to go, and
press the forward key to go in that direction. You have full
three-dimensional freedom. Unfortunately, as in real life, you
may lose your bearings while underwater. Use jump (the space bar
or Enter key) to kick straight up towards the surface.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Once on the surface, tread
water by holding down jump. To get out of the drink, swim towards
the shore. Once there, use jump to clamber up. If you're down a
well or you can't get a grip, you may not be able to climb out.
There is always another way out, but you may have to submerge to
find it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Shooting</strong>: Tap
the Ctrl key or the left mouse button to fire. Hold shoot down to
keep firing. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Use</strong>: Quake has
no 'use' function. To push a button or open a door, walk up to it
or, in some cases, shoot it. To ride a platform up, step onto it.
If a door won't open or a platform won't lower, you may need to
do something special to activate it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Picking up stuff: </strong>To
pick up items, weapons, and power-ups, walk over them. If you
can't pick up something, it means you already have the maximum
possible. If it is armor, it means the stuff you're trying to get
is worse than what you now have. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4"><strong>Finding Things</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Buttons and
Floorplates: </strong>Buttons activate with a touch, and
floorplates must be stepped on. If you see a distinctive-looking
button in a spot you cannot reach, it's probably a shootable
button - fire at it. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Doors</strong>: Most
doors open at your approach. If one doesn't, seek a button,
floorplate, or key.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Secret Doors: </strong>Some
doors are camouflaged. Almost all secret doors open when they are
shot or hit with an axe. The rest are opened by hidden pressure
plates or buttons. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Platforms</strong>:
Most platforms only go up and down, while some follow tracks
around rooms or levels. Normally, when you step onto a platform,
it rises to its full height, and lowers when you step off. Some
platforms drop when you step onto them, and some don't work until
you activate them via button or pressure plate. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Pressure Plates &amp;
Motion Detectors: </strong>Invisible or visible sensors can open
doors, unleash traps, warn monsters, etc. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Uncovering Secrets: </strong>Secrets
are hidden in many ways. You might need to shoot a button, kill a
monster, walk through a secret motion detector, etc. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>The Secret of Secrets: </strong>All
secrets in Quake Mission Pack #1 are indicated by clues. Don't
waste your time hacking at every wall. It's much more productive
(and fun) to use your brain and your eyes. Look up. An angled
texture, a light shining under a wall, a strange
sound...anything...might be the clue. Something prominent in a
room might be decoration...or it might be the clue.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: Bouncing
a grenade off a shootable button or secret door won't open it,
but if the grenade's explosion goes off nearby, this may well
activate such secrets. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Tap the Escape key to pop up
the Main Menu. While you are in the menu, the game is paused. The
Main Menu is pretty much self-explanatory, but if you have
questions, </font><a href="README.htm"><font color="#000000"

explains all. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: Quake
Mission Pack #1 saves your current key configuration when you

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Console </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Tap the ~ (tilde) key to bring

down, a single player game is paused. A wide variety of esoteric
commands can be entered at the console. If your keyboard has no ~

GAME</strong></font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>The Screen</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The large top part of the
screen is the view area, in which you see monsters and
architecture. Immediately below is the Inventory Bar. Below that
is the Status Bar. You can enlarge the viewing area (tap the +
key), so much that it engulfs first the Inventory Bar and then
the Status Bar. The '-' key shrinks the view area.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Inventory Bar</strong>:
Lists ammo, weapons, deathmatch scores, and power-ups.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">The active weapon is lit up.
Each weapon has a number by it Ð type the appropriate number key
to switch to that weapon. In deathmatch, the top four scores are
displayed, along with the color(s) of those players.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Status Bar</strong>: A
vital part of the screen. When your armor, hit points, or ammo
gets low, the number turns red. That's a hint, pal.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">While in Multiplayer Mode,
pressing TAB shows the normal stuff you would see in
Single-player Mode, but over the game screen the entire Rankings
List will be displayed (just like when you die in Deathmatch
Mode).</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Score Bar</strong>:
Hold down the Tab key to replace the Status Bar with the Score
Bar. This lists the proportion of monsters you've killed, secrets
you've found, and time you've spent, along with the level name.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Messages</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Quake talks to you from time to
time. Some messages appear at the top of the screen. These are
non-critical, and tell you that you've picked up an object, or
you've died in an interesting fashion. Ignore these messages if
you please.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Certain messages appear in the
middle of your view area. These are always important, and you do
not want to ignore them!</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Ending a Level</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Once you finish a level, you'll
find a slipgate, a distinctive archway, or a gaping hole in the
ground leading to the next level. Pass through to emerge in a new
level. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">You start the new level with
the same hit points, armor, weapons, and ammo you had at the end
of the previous one. Except that if you have over 100 hit points
(due to the mega health power-up), you start the new level at
100. If a power-up was active at the end of the previous level,
sadly, it is no longer in effect. Make the best of it. </font></p>

<p><a name="YOUR NEW ENVIRONMENT"><font color="#000000" size="5">YOUR
NEW ENVIRONMENT</font></a></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>New Weapons in Quake
Mission Pack #1 (Scourge of Armagon)</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Proximity Mine
Launcher:</strong> These are definitely not your typical grenade
launchers. Gameplay reaches new heights of strategic intensity
with these motion-sensitive mines. Launch them into walls and
ceilings and leave a little surprise for your enemies.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Laser Cannon</strong>:
This weapon emits a series of laser blasts that disintegrates
anything in its path. The laser canon will have the ability to
bounce off an inanimate object at least once; in tight quarters,
maybe twice.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Mjolnir:</strong> This
is THOR's War Hammer. Electrical by nature, when hammered to the
floor it sends out a scattered electrical force along the ground.
An ear-piercing clap of thunder will sound when the opponent is
struck. The electrical current can spread from one opponent to
the next. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP:</strong> The
proximity mines stick to walls and floors. Use them strategically
to lay waste to your enemies.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Switching Between
Weapons</strong>: if you are firing a weapon and run out of ammo,
Quake automatically switches you to another weapon. It will never
switch to the grenade launcher or rocket launcher, however, for
reasons that ought to be obvious. So if you're firing away
happily and suddenly switch to the axe, it doesn't mean you're
out of ammo Ð you probably still have grenades. But Quake
requires you to switch to these dangerous explosives on your own.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>New Powerups in Quake
Mission Pack #1</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Horn of Conjuring: </strong>Upon
activation, a random creature is spawned in to protect you. This
creature will fight by your side and help you destroy all of your
enemies. The creature will continue to fight for you until he is
killed. Be careful though, you can accidentally kill your servant
creature.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Empathy Shield: </strong>When
this magic shield is activated, all damage received by the player
is split between the player and the attacker. 'Feel my pain,
buddy!'</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Wetsuit</strong>:
Provides immunity to all lightning attacks. Also, allows player
better underwater propulsion and the ability to fire electrical
weapons underwater without damage to himself.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>New Creatures in Quake
Mission Pack #1</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Gremlin</strong>: These
creatures travel in packs attacking like a swarm of bees to steal
your weapons and feast on the bodies of your slain enemies. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Centroid</strong>:
These armor-plated, techno-advanced scorpion creatures are huge
and pissed. They carry dual nail guns for claws to get your
attention, but get too close and you'll have a stinger in your
face. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: Some
weapons are better vs. particular monsters than others. If a new
monster seems real tough, switch weapons. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>New Environmental
Hazards and Effects in Quake Mission Pack #1: </strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Fall Away/Exploding
Walls</strong>: These floors fall away instantly when stepped on
or create an earth-splitting QUAKE. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Spike Mines</strong>:
Floating mines of flesh and steel that wander the levels and
unleash a devastating shower of spikes when in proximity of a
player. If you keep your eyes on the mine they will charge at you
slower, but turn your back and they will destroy you. Use the
spike mines to your advantage by leading them into other
creatures.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Lightning Traps</strong>:
The Surgeon General recommends that these periodic bursts of
lightning are hazardous to your health. Avoid them 'If you can!'</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>Falling Rocks</strong>:
Some areas have rocks or boulders that will damage unsuspecting
players.</font></p>

href="README.htm"><font color="#000000" size="2">README.TXT</font></a><font
color="#000000" size="2"> contains details that may be useful if
your network or modem need special configurations.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Cooperative</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">In a co-op game, you and your
friends work together to finish the level. When one person exits,
everyone else exits too, wherever they might be. If you are
killed in co-op, you reappear at the start area, and have to
catch up to your buddies. Use Talk to find out where they are.
See the Multiplayer options on the Main Menu for more info. </font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Deathmatch</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">In a deathmatch, play is
totally cutthroat. No monsters exist, and when you are killed,
you reappear in a random spot. After you pick up an item, it
respawns (i.e. pops back into existence) after a while. (Some
items take longer to respawn than others.) Every time you kill
someone, you get a Frag. The person with the most Frags wins, so
wreak slaughter amongst your pals!</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">If you kill yourself, whether
intentionally or by accident, you lose a Frag. This includes
drowning, getting crushed, and so forth. See the Multiplayer
options on the Main Menu for more info.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3"><strong>Team Games</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2">Team play is a cool combination
of co-op and deathmatch. Each team picks a 'uniform' and everyone
on that team changes their color to the team color. The team with
the most Frags wins. See MANUAL.TXT or the Main Menu for details.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="2"><strong>TIP</strong>: If you
have the Team Color Rules set to No Friendly Fire, your weapons
won't hurt other players wearing the same color pants as you.
(You can still have differently colored shirts.) Your shots still
wear away their armor, and your own grenade and rocket explosions
still hurt you, but not them. </font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q:</font><font color="#000000"
size="2"> Why do creatures summoned by the Horn of Conjuring
often act really stupid?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">A:</font><font color="#000000"
size="2"> The conjuring process often affects the feeble minds of
the creatures adversely. As a result, the creatures often have a
difficult time performing. Conjured creatures are commanded to
follow you whenever they are not fighting another creature. You
can use that to your advantage by leading the charmed creature to
an enemy you are trying to destroy.</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q:</font><font color="#000000"
size="2"> How do I stop Gremlins from stealing my weapon?</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="4">A:</font><font color="#000000"
size="2"> Gremlins are crafty little devils, but they do have
their limits. A Gremlin will not steal your Mjolnir, standard
shotgun or axe. By switching to one of these weapons, he won't be
able to steal your weapon.</font></p>
