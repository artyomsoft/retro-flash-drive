Quake Installation Guide
========================

This guide describes how to install Quake on your system.  Whether you are 
running DOS, Windows 95, or Windows NT, the following instructions will make 
it easy for you to get Quake up and running in no time.  In addition to the 
original Quake executable (QUAKE.EXE), this CD-ROM also contains three other 
.EXE files:  WINQUAKE.EXE, GLQUAKE.EXE, and VQUAKE.EXE.  Gameplay is identi-
cal in each version;  the only differences lie in the specifications of the 
target system.  If you are running Windows 95 or Windows NT, you will in-
stall WINQUAKE.EXE (which has been optimized for Windows 95 / NT), and
GLQUAKE (which runs on Windows 95 / NT, and is optimized for Open GL
accelerated graphics cards).  If you are running DOS, you will install
QUAKE.EXE and VQUAKE (which has been optimized for the RenditionT Verite
chipset video cards).  If you are using a video board that utilizes either
OpenGL standards, or the Verite Chipset, you should experience improved
performance.

We would like to thank Gandalf Technologies, Inc. for the use of their tech-  
nology.  We would also like to thank Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails for
their tremendous contributions to Quake's entire audio portion.

System Requirements
===================

General Requirements
--------------------
CPU:  Pentium 75 MHz processor or better (absolutely must have a 
      math coprocessor!)
Operating System:  Windows 95 or DOS 5.0 (or higher).  See Specialized Re-
		   quirements, below.      
Display:  VGA Compatible Display or better
Memory: DOS:  8 MB RAM (16 recommended)
Windows 95 or Windows NT: 16MB RAM (24+ recommended)
CD-ROM drive:  2X or faster
Hard Drive Space:  80 MB available

Optional (yet highly recommended)
---------------------------------
- Joystick or mouse
- A 28.8K modem or faster
- SoundBlaster or 100% compatible sound board
- A TCP/IP or IPX/SPX network for network play

Specialized Requirements
------------------------
For WINQUAKE.EXE:  Windows 95 or Windows NT.
For QUAKE.EXE:     Windows 95 or DOS 5.0 (or higher).
For GLQUAKE.EXE:   Windows 95 or Windows NT; GLQUAKE supports some OpenGL 3D 
		   accelerator cards.  Consult your hardware manufacturer to
		   determine compatibility.
For VQUAKE.EXE:    Windows 95 or DOS 5.0 (or higher); Rendition Verite
		   Chipset Video Card.

**  IMPORTANT!  **
Quake requires a floating-point unit (FPU, or math coprocessor).  Systems 
that do not have an FPU installed will not run Quake -- at all.  This in-
cludes the now infamous "Pentium class performance, for less money" knock-
off chip.  If you have one of these, then you know which one we're talking 
about, and it won't work.


Installation
============

Windows 95 or Windows NT Installation
-------------------------------------
WinQuake is autoplay-enabled for Windows 95.  Insert the Quake CD in your 
CD-ROM drive and wait a few moments for the autoplay window to appear.  When 
it does, click the Install button to begin installation.  If the autoplay 
window does not appear (or if you are running Windows NT), follow these in-
structions:

1. Double-click the My Computer icon to open the corresponding window;
2. Double-click the CD-ROM icon (typically Drive D: or E:);
3. Double-click the 'Setup' icon;
4. Follow the onscreen prompts.

It's a good idea to view the README file for any last minute changes that 
may have occurred after the manual or this booklet went to press.  See 
"Viewing the README file" below for instructions.


DOS Installation
----------------
If you are running Windows 3.1 you need to exit to DOS before you can in-
stall or play the DOS version of Quake.  To do this, click File in the upper 
left corner of your Program Manager window and select Exit Windows. and 
click OK.  Then follow these instructions:

1. Insert the Quake CD in your CD-ROM drive (typically Drive D: or E:);
2. Switch to that drive by typing D: (or the appropriate drive designation) 
and pressing <Enter>;
3. At the D: prompt, type:  INSTALL C:\QUAKE (or Drive:\Directory where you 
want to install Quake) and press <Enter>;
4. Follow the onscreen prompts.  When Quake has finished installing, the 
installation program will prompt you to continue.  Press any key to start 
the game.

* Please note, running INSTALL.BAT, instead of SETUP.EXE will install ONLY 
the MS-DOS versions of Quake, QUAKE.EXE and VQUAKE.EXE.  If you want to be 
able to run WINQUAKE.EXE or GLQUAKE.EXE, you must run SETUP.EXE (see "Win-
dows 95 or Windows NT Installation" above).

   cards to run.  Also note that Quake.exe requires MS-DOS or Windows 95 to
   run, it will not run under Windows NT.  Check with your 3D accelerator
