            Copyright (C) 1991-2000 Vsevolod V. Volkov


This is a TEST  version of the Commander which is preliminary in
design.  You should not use it for normal work. Any features may
be  changed between now and the final release. Please report any
bugs that you find to me.

The Volkov Commander is a DOS  program, but it supports a lot of
features in Windows 95 and OS/2.


New features in this version:
-----------------------------

1. Descriptions.
   VC supports description files like DESCRIPT.ION or FILES.BBS.
   It shows them and optionaly can copy.

2. Archives.
   You  can  enter in archives  like in subdirectory, then view,
   edit  compressed  files, copy them to any directory (extract)
   or copy uncompressed files to archive.  You can define almost
   any  archive  utility to work with Commander. Long file names
   are supported for archives.

3. SVGA video modes.
   The Commander can work in any text mode with resolution 80x25
   characters  or  higher.  Use  Ctrl-F9  to  switch  text modes
   supported by VBE or use any external utility.

4. EMS, XMS and disk swapping.
   The  Commander  optionally  can  use  EMS, XMS memory or disk
   space  for  reducing  resident  part  of  VC  when  executing
   programs. Run VC /? to view switches.

5. Reversed sort order.
   You can sort files in ascending or descending modes.

6. New filters.
   You can define Your own set of filters.

7. Treeinfo.
   VC doesn't support TREEINFO.NCD  now, but supports new format
   of TREEINFO.VCD  that can be stored in the root of disk or in
   home  directory  of VC.  VC updates these files when creates,
   removes or renames directories.

8. Attributes of directories.
   You can change attributes of directories in Tree panel.

9. New  macros  for inactive panel in VC.MNU and *.EXT files: %,
   %.%, %%, %:, %\, %@.  New  macros  for  short names !~, !~.!,
   !~\, !~@, %~, %~.%, %~\, %~@.  Macros  for  entering  strings
   ![text], !0,..., !9.

10.Internal viewer and 'Find File' function supports translation
   tables   with   single-byte  and  double-byte  character  set
   (Unicode).  You can find these tables in files with extension
   TBL.  Copy tables in directory of VC and use F8 to select one
   of them in internal viewer

11.Quick View  function  can display contents of files including
   files  from archives, information about directories, archives
   and directories in archives

12.VC.COM  and VC.OVL can be compressed. VC.COM can be converted
   to VC.EXE and VC.OVL can be appended to it:

         COM2EXE VC.COM VC.EXE
         PKLITE VC.EXE
         COPY VC.OVL VCOVL.EXE
         PKLITE VCOVL.EXE
         COPY VC.EXE + VCOVL.EXE
