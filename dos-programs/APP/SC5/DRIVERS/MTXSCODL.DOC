MATRIX SCODL (QVP) SYSTEM
____________________________________________________________________________

FILENAME : MTXSCODL.SYS

DEVICE TYPE : CAMERA

    NOTE: driver outputs SCODL opcodes for MATRIX QVP graphics processor. 
    QVP can output to several different devices, the most common of which are 
    cameras. Because this driver does not know the eventual graphics device,
    the device driver itself does not support non preserve aspect ratio mode. 
    If you wish non preserve aspect ratio mode, you must modify the QVP 
    dimensioning appropriately. SCODL arcs, circles, and text may not work 
    as expected if the aspect ratio is not preserved.

    The exact output method used by the driver is controlled by the environ-
    ment variable "mtxs_out". Data can be sent directly to the QVP0: device,
    a file (explicitly or automatically named), or to the current VDI COM:
    port.

    Please see additional notes on operation for specific setups for the
    MVP and QVP/SA (stand alone) processors.

    FEATURES SUPPORTED

    POLYLINES

    Lines and arcs can be drawn with the six line styles as listed below:

     1   _____________________________________    Solid
     2   __________          __________           Long Dash
     3   .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .     Dotted
     4   ________      .     ________     .       Dash Dotted
     5   _____     _____     _____     _____      Medium Dashed
     6   _______    .    .   ________    .    .   Dash with two dots

    Line widths can be from 4 to 8192 NDC coordinates. The actual line width
    depends on the device. For a 1536 by 2048 device like the  MATRIX QCR or 
    MATRIX PCR, the actual line widths will vary from 1 to 512 pixels.

    GRAPHICS TEXT
    The system supports fully scaleable sizes from 1 to 32767 in NDC space. 
    The default graphics text cell size is 408 in NDC space. The number of 
    fonts supported depends on the number of fonts loaded into the MATRIX QVP.
    This driver does not assume the existence or absence of any fonts except 
    for the default SCODL font (0).

    NOTE: It is possible to reference nonexistent fonts. This will cause SCODL
    errors. Since SCODL fonts are numbered beginning at zero and VDI fonts are
    numbered beginning at one, the font numbers requested through the VDI will
    correspond to the SCODL font numbered one lower.

    The default SCODL font used may be set via the environment variable 
    "mtxs_font". The value of "mtxs_font" corresponds to the SCODL font, 
    so the VDI font number will be one higher.

    Graphics text may be rotated in tenth degree increments.

    GRAPHICS MARKERS
    The system supports six markers, as follows:

      1 = small Box
      2 = Cross
      3 = Star (asterisk)
      4 = Box   
      5 = X
      6 = Diamond

    Markers have five sizes as listed below in NDC coordinates:

                           Preserve Aspect 
              Size            Ratio Mode 
       
                1                316
                2                628
                3                940
                4               1252
                5               1564 

    FILLED AREAS
    Filled areas, bars, pie slices and circles are all drawn using the 
    current fill area attributes of color, interior style, and style index. 
    The interior styles of Hollow, Solid, and Hatch are all supported by this 
    device.  The interior style of Pattern is mapped to the hatch interior 
    style.  Six different styles are supported for the hatch interior style:
     
      1 = Narrow diagonal
      2 = Medium diagonal
      3 = Wide diagonal
      4 = Narrow crosshatch
      5 = Medium crosshatch
      6 = Wide crosshatch

    COLOR
    The system supports 255 colors. By default, eight colors are defined by 
    the driver:

              RGB values
       Index   Red    Green   Blue     Color
      
        0       0        0      0     Black
        1    1000     1000   1000     White
        2    1000        0      0     Red
        3       0     1000      0     Green
        4       0        0   1000     Blue
        5    1000     1000      0     Yellow
        6       0     1000   1000     Cyan
        7    1000        0   1000     Magenta
    
    Note that these are all saturated colors and do not compensate for the
    film used if the output device is a camera. The environment variable
    "mtxs_lutc" may be used to select the type of color LUT compensation.

    The remaining indices from 8 to 254 default to white.

    It is possible to preset the SCODL color map in the normal SCODL fashion. 
    Setting the environment variable "mtxs_cmap" to "preset" will prevent
    the driver from setting the default color map. The color map will only
    be set via explicit requests through the VDI.

    PIXEL OPERATIONS
    This driver supports the CGI OUTPUT BYTE PIXEL ARRAY opcode.

    RASTER WRITING MODES
    Only replace is supported.

    
    CURSOR ADDRESSABLE TEXT
    not supported

    
    ALPHA TEXT
    Alpha text can be positioned anywhere on the output page. Alpha text may
    be scaled in multiples of 408 NDC units from 1*408 to 20*408 units. The
    SCODL font used may be set via the environment variable "mtxs_font". 

    Alpha text provides two versions of the user set font. Alpha text fonts
    between 1 and 256 reference SCODL fonts between 0 and 255. If the alpha
    text font is between 257 and 512, a bold (thickened) version of the font 
    numbered 256 lower will be used. Thus, selecting alpha text font 3 would
    cause alphatext to use SCODL font 2. Selecting alphatext font 259 would 
    yield a boldened SCODL font 2.

    The default alpha text font is set by the environment variable 
    "mtxs_font",just as it is for graphics text. The default is SCODL font 0, 
    which is VDI font 1.

    Alphatext line spacing, overstrike, underlining, and superscript modes
    are all supported.

    NOTES:
    This driver uses a SCODL virtual space of -4096 to +4095. All user set
    SCODL scaling, etc. will be affected by this.

    SCODL GSF(tm) mode is reset at the end of every image. If GSF mode has
    been preset, it will only affect the first image.

    Alphatext pass through mode is available to insert raw SCODL commands
    into the output stream.

    All SCODL output is in binary form.  This mode must be set if using the
    Stand Alone unit.
          
    SPECIAL INFORMATION

    This driver uses several environment variables to control various aspects
    of it's operation. Some have been mentioned previously as they pertained
    to particular features being described.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAME : MTXS_OUT

VALUES : "QVP", "qvp", "COM", "com", filename

DEFAULT : undefined (implying automatically named file)

DESCRIPTION   
    This environment variable controls the output device. If "QVP" or
"qvp", the QVP0: device will receive all data from the driver as it is gen-
erated. MTXSCODL will assume the QVP channel is set up appropriately
(binary mode). The QVP driver must be installed and operating correctly as
MTXSCODL cannot check this.

    If "COM" or "com", the current port will be opened and all driver data 
will be sent to it. Again, the driver assumes the port's mode will be preset
correctly. By default, the current port is COM1:. The user may change this
using the standard GSS-DRIVERS method of doing a SET MTXSCODL=COMn, where
n is the new default COM number.

    If anything other than these four values, the string will be taken
as a filename to use unless it is null. If it is null, a filename will be
automatically generated (see MTXS_FNUM, below). If the file already exists,
it will not be used, and another filename will be automatically generated.  
The filename may include the full file path, including the drive specification.
Note that an extension of ".SCD" is always provided.

NAME : MTXS_FNUM
VALUES : 0 to 9999
DEFAULT : 0

DESCRIPTION   
    This environment variable controls the initial numeric portion of an
automatically generated filename used for driver file output. The format of an
automatically  generated filename is "VDInnnn.SCD", where "nnnn" is a unique
number. This environment variable controls the initial value the driver will 
attempt to use to generate a filename. If undefined, "VDI0000.SCD" will be 
the first filename tried.

    If the filename generated already exists, the driver will try the
next numerically higher filename until the desired filename is unique to
the current directory. This filename will then be used.

NAME : MTXS_FONT
VALUES : 0 to 255
DEFAULT : 0

DESCRIPTION   
    This environment variable controls the default text font. If the user
does not specify a font through the VDI, this is the font that will be used. 
Note that since the driver does not know the number of fonts, it cannot test
this value for validity. SCODL will fail if an unknown font is referenced.

NAME : MTXS_TXSP
VALUES : "K", "k", "B", "b", "P", "p"
DEFAULT : "K"

DESCRIPTION
    This environment variable controls the graphics text spacing. "K" sets
kerned spacing, "B" sets block spacing, and "P" sets proportional spacing.

NAME : MTXS_CMAP
VALUES : "PRESET", "preset"
DEFAULT : undefined (implies driver is to set default color map)

DESCRIPTION   
    This environment variable controls whether or not the driver auto-
matically sets the default VDI color map. If "PRESET", the driver assumes the 
user has already set up the color map and does not set any color map entries 
except by explicit VDI request. If other than "PRESET", the driver sets up 
the default VDI color map of black, white, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, 
and magenta for the first 8 entries. All other entries are set to white.

NAME : MTXS_DEV
VALUES : 1 to 255, 0 to 255 (example: 1,0)
DEFAULT : undefined- device not set or changed by driver

DESCRIPTION
    This environment variable is provided for advanced use and controls 
the SCODL output device. If defined, the output device, dimensions, etc. are 
set. If null or undefined, the output device will not be set. The first 
number determines the device; the second number controls the device mode. If 
the comma and the second value are omitted, a mode of 0 will be assumed. 
The current limits on these values are enforced, and no SCODL opcodes are
sent if the device is not one of those currently supported (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,
and 12).

    The SCODL opcodes sent are the same as those in the standard "switch"
files swiq2.scd, swiq4.scd, swidiabl.scd, switekl.scd, swiseik.scd, 
switecq.scd and swittl.scd with the "set virtual screen maximum dimensions" 
opcode (249) modified to match the 8192 virtual space used by this driver. 
Note that this does not allow for several of the possible output formats; 
if presently unsupported devices or other output formats are required, 
use "mtxs_swif","mtxs_xdim", "mtxs_x1", etc. to output the desired SCODL 
commands.

     VALUE      DEVICE
       1        Null device (default)
       2        QCR or PCR film recorder
       3        Xerox 4020 or Diablo C-150 ink-jet printer
       4        Tektronix 4696 or 4695 ink-jet printer
       5        (not yet SCODL defined)
       8        Tecmar graphics master disply adapter
      12        Matrix TT200 thermal transfer printer with color ink sheet

NAME : MTXS_SWIF    
VALUES : file name of switch file
DEFAULT : null (nothing done)

DESCRIPTION
    This environment variable allows you to name a switch file to be
inserted in the SCODL opcode stream when the driver is opened. A full DOS
pathname, including drive, is acceptable.

    This feature may be used to support any device and any output format.
It has precedence over "mtxs_dev", but it is not recomended they be used
at the same time.

NAME : MTXS_XDIM, MTXS_YDIM
VALUES : 2 to 32768
DEFAULT : not set/changed

DESCRIPTION 
    These environment variables are provided for advanced use and control 
the virtual screen maximum dimensions. The values provided to these 
environment variables are placed directly into SCODL opcode 249, subcommand 1.
If either of these environment variables is undefined or out of range, the
driver will assume XDIM and YDIM have been set up via a switch file and will 
not send a SCODL opcode 249.

    Note that the driver ALWAYS uses coordinates from -4096 to 4095 and that
the virtual dimension scaling only has to scale from this space down to the
device space and does not have to scale the entire SCODL +-16383 space down to
device space. 

    These environment variables have precedence over "mtxs_dev" and
"mtxs_swif". The opcodes produced are sent after those from "mtxs_dev" and
"mtxs_swif".

NAME : MTXS_X1, MTXS_X2, MTXS_Y1, MTXS_Y2
VALUES : -32766 to +32766
DEFAULT : not set/changed

DESCRIPTION   
    These environment variables are provided for advanced use and are used
to set the X1, X2, Y1, and Y2 values used by SCODL opcode 250. If any of these
environment variables are undefined or out of range, the driver will assume 
X1, X2, X3, and X4 have been set with a switch file. Note that the driver will
not supply SCODL with coordinates < -4096 or > 4095.

    These environment variables have precedence over "mtxs_dev" and
"mtxs_swif". 

NAME : MTXS_LUTC
VALUES : 0 to 255
DEFAULT : not set/changed

DESCRIPTION   
    This environment variable controls the subcommand byte to SCODL
opcode 215. LUT compensation is automatically turned on using SCODL opcode
211.

EXAMPLES OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE USE

Suppose you have a MATRIX PCR you wish to make slides on from an applications
program using the VDI. If you don't have or want to use a SCODL switch file, 
the proper environment variable setup would be:

NOTE: these image dimensions do not take into account scaling necessary to
keep image inside slide mount.

set mtxs_dev=2,0        select QCR (PCR), 2K mode - mode only avail. for PCR
set mtxs_dev=2          select QCR (PCR), default 2K mode

Other possible settings:

set mtxs_xdim=7800      set XDIM smaller to get slide inside mount
set mtxs_ydim=7800      set YDIM smaller to get slide inside mount

set mtxs_x1=-500        set x1, x2, y1, and y2 to get smaller output
set mtxs_x2=500         area
set mtxs_y1=500
set mtxs_y2=-500

set mtxs_out=qvp        send data directly to qvp0:
set mtxs_out=com        send data to remote QVP via com port

set mtxs_out=b:\images\test.scd send data to named file on drive b
set mtxs_out=local.scd      send data to named file in current directory
set mtxs_out=           send data to automatically named file in current
                directory

set mtxs_fnum=30        start auto filenames at 30

set mtxs_font=5         set default font to preloaded SCODL font 5
                (VDI font 6)

set mtxs_txsp=p         set proportional spaced graphtext
set mtxs_txsp=b         set block spaced graphtext

set mtxs_cmap=preset        use preset SCODL color map

set mtxs_swif=c:\qvp\util\swi_new.scd  send this switch file when driver opened
set mtxs_lutc=2         select Polaroid 559 color map compensation

Additional Notes on Operation.
_____________________________________________________________________________

QVP/SA.

     If the stand alone version of the QVP is being used rather than the
internal (QVP0) version, there are several precautions and operational
procedures that should be noted.

  Setup.

     Once the QVP is physically connected via serial communations port, a
configuration file must be sent to setup communications and output device.
(Note it is understood that the newer version of the QVP, the MVP, does not
require a setup file, but has physical switches for appropriate setup
parameters.)  The QVP establishes proper baud rate, data and stop bits, and
parity by analyizing a stream of characters sent to it from the serial port.
After proper communications are setup, a configuration record is sent to 
set other specific parameters, such as output device and date type.  In order
to send this file to the QVP, the serial port must recognize that the QVP is
attached and ready to except data.  

If the QVP is connected to COM1, no write errors ("ERROR WRITING TO DEVICE
COMn; Abort, Retry, Ignore?") may occur while copying the file to the port,
and if so, they may be  corrected by simply powering down both the PC and the
QVP and powering up again, PC first.  However, if the QVP is connected to
an AST or similar board that contains COM2, write errors may not be corrected
unless physical modifications are made to the board.  These modifications are
simply forcing  both the CTS (clear to send) and DSR (data set ready) inputs
on the serial port to be TRUE.  It should also be noted that both inputs
(pins) 2 and 3, RxD, and TxD are flipped for proper communications with the
QVP.

  The Lock-in file.

     The lock-in file (setup file) is sent to the QVP by simply copying it
to the appropriate serial port with the DOS copy command.  The lock-in file
contains a stream of the characters 0, 1, and 2 that allow the QVP to
configure itself with the proper communications and a configuration record at
the bottom of the file which sets up specific parameters.  The configuration
record may be modified by the user to suit specific needs.

             LOCK-IN FILE:  QVPLOCK.DAT
                 LOCATION:

     The configuration record consists of 16 bytes, 12 which represent setup
parameters given in hexadecimal format converted from a binary representation
of setup options.

     Record format:  _N3F0F05010802.J

     First two bytes: 'space'N   -   signals configuration follows
     Last two bytes : .J         -   signals configuration complete

     Twelve bytes between are defined as follows:   

     HEX  BINARY        Possible settings (each represents on/off or yes/no
     ---  ---------            with binary 0 or 1, n/a=not applicable)
     3F   0011 1111   (selects current data bits, parity, and stop bits)
     0F   0000 1111   (selects current baud rate)
     05   0000 0101   (n/a), PSE/N, MSG TERM/N, MSG HOST/N, CTS/N, IGN/Y,
                      DTR/N, XON/Y    (communications)
     01   0000 0001   First byte - n/a, Output device mode; QCR and PCR
                      resolution only: 0001 for 4k and  0000 for 2k
     08   0000 1000   First byte - n/a, BINARY data, RPT/N, WAIT,N, +BGN/N
     02   0000 0010   First byte - n/a, Output device (see below)

     Communications may be changed if serial port being used may utilize
     CTS and DTR.

     Driver outputs SCODL code in BINARY format.

     Possible output devices:

                           0000  Null device
                           0010  PCR film recorder
                           (see the QVP User's guide for other devices)

     DO NOT change first two and last two bytes ( ' N' and '.J').

     Please consult your QVP User's guide for more information regarding
     communications and setup parameters.


  Output device dimensions.

     For the PCR film recorder the optimal screen dimensions, specified
by the environmentals MTXS_XDIM and MTXS_YDIM, were found for both 2k and
4k resolution.

        Resolution      MTXS_XDIM     MTXS_YDIM

            2k            7500          7500
            4k            15000         15000

     Note:  MTXS_XDIM must equal MTXS_YDIM to preserve the aspect ratio.
            These values are written directly in to SCODL opcode 249
            subcommand 1.


  Sending image to the QVP.

     As noted in the discussion of the environmental MTXS_OUT, the file
generated may be sent to any of three locations; the internal QVP0, to
a serial port, or to a file.  This is treated just like any other output
device, allowing for immediate printing, later spooling, or batch printing.
However several precautions should be taken to insure proper processing of
output file.  If CTS or DTR communications are not established between the
serial port and the QVP, only ONE file may be processed at a time.  This
means that batch processing and spooling of more than one file will cause
undesirable results.
     If image is sent to a file, the file must be copied to the serial port
with the binary option, '/b'.

         COPY IMAGE.SCD COM2: /B

MVP and MVP/SA.

  Driver modifications.

     If the vector processor being utilized is the newer version of the QVP,
the MVP, the MTXSCODL driver must be modified for proper operation.  This 
modification is made simply by running a routine in the same directory as the
driver.  This routine toggles the change and notes what device the driver
is set up to recognize.

    To change driver:  Copy MTX.EXE from the INSTALLATION diskette into the
    same directory as MTXSCODL driver and type 'MTX'.  
ata and stop bits, and
parity by ana
