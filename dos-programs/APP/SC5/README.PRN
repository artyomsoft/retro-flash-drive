In addition to the above listed files, the SAMPLE, TUTORIAL and DRIVERS
directories contain SAMPLE files, a comprehensive TUTORIAL system
which discusses the major components of the product and DRIVER files
for CGI graphics output.

The FONTS directory is used exclusively for Bitstream font data file
creation and usage.  These files are created during program execution
and are used for print preview and spreadsheet printing in Final mode.
These files can be deleted when disk space is low.  CA-SuperCalc
recreates the files when needed.

INFORMATION FOR UPGRADERS
------------------------------------------------------------

Configuration File compatibility
--------------------------------
This release supports configuration files (*.cfg files) that were
created in CA-SuperCalc version 5.1.

Configuration files created in SuperCalc version 5.0 are NOT supported.


Output,Printer,Options Settings
-------------------------------
Due to the addition of paper size support and measurement in various units,
the default settings for spreadsheet printing has been set to inches
instead of characters.

The Report,Formatted settings is set to FINAL instead of DRAFT.

If you have macros that require the default print settings to be
in characters and the report format to be Draft, we recommend that
you copy the file DRAFT.CFG as SCC.OVL using the DOS copy command.

For example: C:\CALC>Copy draft.cfg scc.ovl

This will change the default print settings for the product to match
the CA-SuperCalc Release 5.1 settings.


Usage of Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Z
--------------------------
We recommend that you use the CTRL-BREAK key combination for aborting
commands instead of the old style Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z.  On certain hardware
configurations, Ctrl-C / Ctrl-Z may not initiate an abort process but
will display a ^C / ^Z on the screen.
