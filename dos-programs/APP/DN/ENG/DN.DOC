    Welcome to Dos  Navigator  (C)  RITLABS  S.R.T  -  software, which will
facilitate  your  work  with the personal computer. The rich opportunities
of  Dos  Navigator,  as  a multi-window shell for work in MS-DOS,
OS/2, MS Windows,  Unix  and other, provide the most effective work on
the personal computer.  It  is  easy  to  start  various  programs with
the help of Dos Navigator.  The  program  Dos  Navigator  not  only
helps the user to make work  more  convenient,  it  also  opens
opportunities of the computer so, that it works " in whole power ".

I) Equipment requirements Ü
    ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

    Dos Navigator normally functions in the following conditions:
  - The computer IBM PC/AT or PS/2 or completely compatible with them;
  - The processor: 386SX or higher;
  - Operating system MS DOS 5.0 or later versions;
  - 512Kb Conventional RAM;
  - As the minimum 1.2MB on a hard disk
   (from them 900Kb is taken by necessary systems files);

    The following additional devices are recommended:
  - THE PROCESSOR: 486SX or HIGHER;

  - 4MB XMS/EMS;
    (Dos Navigator uses this memory for editing of the texts, for
    increase of the buffer of copying, for loading an overlay part
    of a code of the program and etc.. Therefore, than it is more of
    memory, that there is more pleasantly your work and that more
    windows you can open).

  - The VGA-compatible VIDEO ADAPTER;
    (It will give you an opportunity to use extended text modes, but
    also beautiful screens).

  - THE DEVICE "MOUSE";
    (With its help you can use all opportunities and all convenience of
    the interface of the user).

  - THE FLOPPY DISK DRIVE;
    (Dos Navigator is delivered on standard 3.5 " or 5.25 "
    diskettes and for installation you will need the floppy disk
    drive, though while in service the disk drive can not be used).

  - CD-ROM;
    (Dos Navigator can to read the information from CD-disks, as from
    usual hard disks or diskettes, but also, can to play sound Compact
    Discs)

  - The HAYES-compatible MODEM.
    (Dos Navigator has built-in communication module for connection
    of your computer by the terminal to BBS. Also through the modem
    it is possible to autodial telephone number).


II)  Run The Dos Navigator Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

    For  start  Dos  Navigator  it is enough  to enter in  subdirectory,
in which   its   working   files   are   located,   and   to  type "DN".
Whereas Dos  Navigator   is   a   system   shell, namely the programs of
such type are used the  most  frequently,  it  is  recommended to  start
DN at loading of your computer,   for  that  insert   a  line DN into  a
file AUTOEXEC.BAT. Besides for  normal  work  of  Dos  Navigator  it  is
completely  necessary, that subdirectory,  in  which  working files   of
Dos  Navigator   are  located  should  be   mentioned  in   a set  PATH,
located in  a file  AUTOEXEC.BAT. So,  for   example,   if   all working
files of  DN are  located in  subdirectory \DN  on a  disk C:, your file
AUTOEXEC.BAT should contain a string PATH C:\DN.


 The note: the updating AUTOEXEC.BAT is made automatically by the
           installation program.


III) Dos Navigator Windows Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     Windows  of  Dos  Navigator  are  working  areas  of  the  program,
in which  it  shows  the  necessary information, and in the majority  of
cases  lets     evidently   work    with   it.   The   presentation   is
understood   as  a  convenient   format   of   representation   of   the
current   information, but  also   operative   change   of  contents  of
windows in case  of change of  the information in  result of fulfillment
of commands, submitted by the user.

     All  set   (rather  large)   windows  can   be  divided   into  two
large  groups:    working   windows    and   dialog   boxes.  The   main
distinction between them   consists  that   you  can   open  a   lot  of
working windows  and switch  from   one   working   window   to another,
while the dialog box in any  moment of  time  can   be  only one on  the
screen, and while it will  not be closed by   a  that  or  other method,
work with other (certainly, working) windows is impossible.

     By  work  in  Dos  Navigator it is possible to open and to use set
of working   windows,   but   in   each   moment   of time there is only
one active window.   An  active   window it is  a window, in  which  you
work in the  given moment. Any  command, which you  choose concerns only
to an active window.

     Dos   Navigator   marks   an    active   window,   drawing   double
framework, due  to   that  it  can  easily be identified on the  screen.
If your  windows are  blocked, the  active window  is always  on the top
("forward" window).

    There are following menu commands for switching between working windows
            ÜÜÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÜÜ
            ÛÛ Tile               ÛÛ
            ÛÛ Cascade            ÛÛ
            ÛÛ Close all          ÛÛ
            ÛÛÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÛÛ
            ÛÛ Size/Move  Ctrl-F5 ÛÛ
            ÛÛ Zoom         Alt-Z ÛÛ
            ÛÛ Next       Alt-Tab ÛÛ
            ÛÛ Previous  Ctrl-Tab ÛÛ
            ÛÛ lose      Ctrl-F4 ÛÛ
            ÛÛÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÛÛ
            ÛÛ List...      Alt-0 ÛÛ
            ßßÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄßß
     The  list  of  all  open  windows  gives  a possibility to choose
the necessary window or to close it from this list.

     If  you  want  to  choose  an  inactive working window, though
only a part  it  is  visible  on  the  screen,  click  on it by
the mouse and the window will become active.

     The  dialog  boxes  are  intended, first of all, for setting those
or other  parameters  of  Dos  Navigator  or  for  issue  of the
various help information, messages, requests and etc..

     The  examples  of  working  (not  dialog boxes) windows are, first
of all, windows of the file panels.

 1. ³File Panel º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

 The file panel is understood as any panel with any list of files:
   - The usual list of files of a directory   (C:\DN)
   - The list of found files                  (Find:)
   - Temporary drive                          (Temp:)
   - Archive                                  (ZIP: ARJ: RAR: etc.)
   - Video cassette of a Arvid streamer       (TDR:)

    Any list is considered as a directory, therefore appearance at
viewing of archive and temporary disk coincide accurate to an
information part.
    The file panels for convenience are linked in pairs. The number of
such windows with dual panels, which refer to as by the File Managers,
is limited only by the size of accessible memory.
    The switching between panels in the File Managers is carried out by
[Tab] or clicking the mouse button in the necessary panel.
    Drag-and-Drop is organized in Dos Navigator, i.e. dragging  of
files in other panels and trees is realized.  Is established optionally
in Options|File Manager|Setup...
         [X] Drag-and-drop from columns.

(The note: It is possible to forbid or to allow the request of a
            directory of purpose
         Options|Configuration|Confirmations... )

    Copying\Moving can be carried out from any panel in any, in
independence of that, to which file managers they belong, thus the
names of directories are substituted in a history of input of dialog
box "Copy".

    Keys of a management:
        [Ctrl-F3]   Manager|New       - Opening of the new file manager
        [Ctrl-F4]   Window|Close      - Closing of a window
        [Alt-Tab]   Window|Next       - Switching to the next window
        [Ctrl-Tab]  Window|Previous   - Switching to the previous  window
        [Tab]                         - Switching between panels

 1.1 File list Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßß
    Viewing of the list of files in a directory with use of a file with
descriptions, if such exists in this directory similarly to a command
"Dir" from the command interpreter 4DOS, if finds a file descript.ion
or files.bbs.
    The names of files with the descriptions are set in
         Options|File Manager|Setup...
The work with the descriptions of files is possible only in a mode of
display of the descriptions:
         - Editing [Alt-INS]
         - Copying, moving, deleting of files with the descriptions
           results in automatic change or generating of new and old
           files with descriptions.

    The names of visible files on the panel are set in a kind of the
filter at setting of parameters of the file panel. The filters work in
all modes of operations of the file panel. If it is necessary to
exclude from the filter any mask, it is possible to set at the end of
the filter -mask. For example: *.*;-*.bak

     The setup of parameters of the current panel is made in
         Panel|Setup Panel...  [Alt-S]

  [ ] Directory length  - count the sizes of subdirectories
  [X] Current file      - show below information about current file
  [X] Selected files    - show below information about selected files
  [ ] Totals            - show below information about current directory
  [X] Free space        - show amount of a free space on a disk
  [X] Executable first  - place executable files in the beginning of the list
  [X] Archives first    - place archives in the beginning of the list
  [X] Files highlight   - highlight files in the panel
     The note: If it is not set the information about chosen files
in the panel, but the files are selected, this information replaces
the information about current file.

   Depending on origin of the list heading of the panel varies:
         - "C:\"  etc.
         - "Find: *.qqp"
         - "TEMP:"
         - "ARJ:DN2-35.ARJ"
         - "TDR:SONY1\ACTION"
    For Find: and TEMP: it is displayed complete way after the
information about current file, for archives - it is displayed
packed size and percent of compression.
    The parameters of the file panel are saved automatically at
start of the external programs or at an exit from Dos Navigator.
    To save current directories in the file panel it is necessary to set
         Options|Configuration|Startup|[X] Preserve directory,
otherwise there will be the current DOS directory in the file panel.

 1.2 Files HighLight Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The files with various extensions can be marked by various colors.
There are 3 standard types: directories, executable files and
archives, but also five types, determined by the user with the help
of the setting of the filter of extensions:
         Options|File Manager|Highlight groups...

     The colors of appropriate types are set in
         Options|Colors...|File Manager
                           ÃÄFile Panel
                           ±±±ÀÄ Highlight±±±

    The marking of files by various colors, except convenience of a
finding of a file, gives yet opportunity to sort files " by color "
i.e. on a group attribute. What does it mean? Imagine the list of
files, which is sorted out so: directories, archives, executable files,
initial texts of the programs, temporary temp-files, sorted out by
color. Instead of looking by eyes for a lost file, you can easily find
it in color group.
     In graphic shells, such as File Manager(MS Windows), Windows),
Norton Desktop (Symantec) and other graphic icons are applied for file
visualization. Some text shells for DOS, such as PC SHELL (Central
Point), DOSSHELL (Microsoft) emulate them with replacement of char set.
Char set is not changed in Dos Navigator, and different colors are used
for allocation of various files.
     What for it is necessary? For example, you, seeing color of a
file, know, that here such - @ the file - graphic, such - @ - musical,
and here this concerns to temporary files (".$$$ ", ".OLD ", ".BAK ")
and it must be deleted.
    The sanction of coloring by various colors is set for each
panel optionally in
         Panel|Setup panel...  [Alt-S]

 1.3 Files Sort Ü [Alt-B] [Alt-S]
      ßßßßßßßßßßß
    The files, displayed in panels, can be sorted by following attributes:
 Name
 Extension
 Size
 Time
 Group     (HighLight groups)
 Unsorted  (To display files according to the order of record in a directory)

    It is set in
         Panel|Sort by... [Alt-B]

    Except usual sorting there is the opportunity to display executable
files in the beginning of the panel [X] Executable first, and archives
[X] Archives first
    It is set in Panel|Setup panel... [Alt-S]

    Executable files are:
         - '.exe', '.com', '.bat'
         - '.btm'        Batch-files for the interpreter 4DOS
         - '.cmd'        Batch-files for operating system OS/2

    Known archives:
         - ARC, ARJ, BSA, BS2, CHZ, HA,
           HAP, HPK, HYP, LHA, LIM, RAR,

    As you can see, for each type of the file panel setting of
information fields in columns are different. These fields can be
arbitrary combined.

    It is set in Panel|Setup columns... [Alt-K]
    Default settings are set in
         Options|File Manager|Columns defaults...

    The number of columns on the screen depends on the size of the
file panel, which, in turn, depends on the number of a video
mode.  Also it depends on a mutual arrangement of two half-
panels (right and left-hand).  It is changed with the help of
[Alt <-] or [Alt ->] or mouse, if to hook for divider and to move
mouse, not releasing the button.  If a mode Description is
established, one column will be displayed only, and to vary there will
be width of a field Description.  Horizontal scrolling inside one
"half-panel" is carried out with arrows < -, - >.

 1.5 File Mask Selection Ü [Alt-Del]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    It is possible to establish the filter of displayed names of files
and extensions, which will be visible in the panel. This filter is set
in the file panel options
         Panel|Setup Panel... [Alt-S]
For example: ?eadme*.*;*.1st
    If it is necessary to exclude from the filter any mask, this is
possible to set at the end of the filter -mask. For example: *.*;-*.bak
The note: ";" plays a role of masks divider.

    For more convenient set of this filter a command serves
         Panel|Advanced filter...   [Alt-Del]
    All extensions in a current directory are scanned and placed in the
list " Mask selection ". The selection of extensions is made also, as
well as selection of files in the file panel. Then at pressing on
<Hide> - the files with chosen extensions leave from the list; <Show> -
in the list there are only the files, the extensions of which were
chosen.
    If it is necessary to display only those extensions, which "are
allowed" in the current filter, for example to continue formation of
this filter, it is possible to press [Shift-Alt-Del]

THE NOTE: the Filter to on - default for new manager is set in
    Options|File Manager|New Manager defaults...

 1.6 Change of Video Modes Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    Change of video modes is carried out in the menu 'ð' [Alt-'Spacebar']
    - EGA/VGA lines [Shift-F10]
Switches the screen from 80x25 in 80x43 (EGA), 80x50 (VGA) and back.
    - Custom Video Mode [Alt-F10] , [Ctrl-F10]
Switches the screen from 80x25 in modes, set by the user in
         Options|Configuration|System setup...

    Numbers of modes are set in a decimal notation. To indicate, that
the number is in hexadecimal notation, it is necessary to deliver
before them a symbol "$", for example $100 = 256 in a decimal notation.
It is possible to use the built - in calculator for transfer from one
notation to another. It is necessary to indicate number of a mode in a
configuration (i.e. significance AL by a call of function AH=0 of
interrupt 10h).  The information on number of a mode can be found in
the documentation of the video adapter.  Any text video modes (such as
132x60, 100x25 etc.) are supported, including VESA (on VESA compatible
video-adapters).
At Custom Video Mode = 256 screen is transferred in a mode 80x30(VGA).
         Options|Configuration|Startup...
              [X] Restore screen mode
    If this option is included, a mode of the screen is restored after
start of any external program, which was before start of this program.

 2. ³File Manager º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
    The file manager is a main window of Dos Navigator for work with
files. The majority of operations over files is made with its help. The
window of the file manager forms by choice of a command Manager|New
[Ctrl-F3] After it Dos Navigator will ask you a name of a disk, for
which you want to start the new Manager, and then you will see a window
of the Manager with two file panels.  You can open few Managers and
copy files from any panel in any with the help of the mouse
(Drag-and-Drop) or history of dialog box "Copy".  After the Manager was
opened, it is possible to cause commands from the menu Manager for its
configuration.

    The file panels are broken in pairs for convenience of fulfillment
of operations Copy\Move, but also for compatibility with Norton
Commander. Moreover it enables to operate with one directory at once in
two panels: Quick view, Info, Directory tree.  At pressing
[Ctrl-Insert] the names of selected files are copied in Clipboard. At
pressing [Ctrl-Del] the names of selected files leave from the current
panel without physical deleting from the drive.

 2.1 Command Line Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The command line of Dos Navigator completely emulates command
language of MS-DOS a little expands it i.e. you can simply type MS-DOS
commands from here.
    The unique exception exists for a command SET of environment
variable  of operating system. It works differently, depending on
whether is set in 'Options|Configuration|System setup...  [X] Fast
command execution', or not.  If it is included mode the command SET
concerns to a "Main" copy COMMAND.COM i.e. to main "process" of
operating system MS-DOS.The start of the program from Dos Navigator is
carried out faster, but in this mode can incorrectly work some DOS
Extenders, for example MS-Windows.
    If "Fast command execution" is set to off Dos Navigator causes a
"new" copy COMMAND.COM, therefore all changes of SET made in it will be
lost at return in Dos Navigator.
    It is possible to make the group of commands for batch processing
(like in .BAT-file) in a command line. The commands are divided by
"||". For 4DOS users this feature is disable.  Parameter %1 means a
name of a current file in the active panel of the file manager. If you
seldom use a command line, it can be removed from the screen
        (Options|Configuration|Interface...
              [X] Hide Command Line).
    Keys of a main set are in this case released, and it became possible
to use them as "Hot" keys for commands and [Shift+Char] for incremental
search.
    The command line can be caused from the menu:
         File|Execute DOS command...  [Alt-F6]
(Command History  is caused as a usual history of a Input Line in this case).

    For convenience of work Dos Navigator lets to save commands, early
entered in a Command line, in a History of commands.  Twice click a
mouse in a Command line or press [Alt-F8] for its call.  It is also
possible to view a History of commands directly in a Command line with
the help [Shift-|] For compatibility with Norton Commander [Ctrl-E]
acts as [Shift-].  The history of commands can be remembered after
exit from Dos Navigator.It will be automatically restored after the

 ³  ( ) Single Ctrl ³ The search will begin after single pressing Ctrl
 ³  ( ) Caps+Char   ³ The search will go while be pressed Caps
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ
    The combination [Ctrl-Enter] forces to continue search on an
entered mask. (Note: as an entered mask a sequence of entered symbols
from a beginnings of search up to [Ctrl-Enter] is considered)

    [Shift+Char] also works if a Command line is hidden

2.11 File Find Ü [Alt-F7]
      ßßßßßßßßßß
    It is possible to look for files with the filter (for example,
*.bak; *.$$$; *.tmp) and with the information contained in them.
When the mask is single the search is carried out "accelerated" in
comparison with a multiple mask.
Mask "*" = "*.*" . By default, if not extension of a file is
entered,  ".*" extension is added to a name of a file.
     The search can be carried out in a current directory, on a current
disk, on all accessible disks. By the way, all this occurs in a
background mode! While there is the search of files, it is possible to
work with already found and placed in Find: files. This list
replenishes in accordance with a finding of new files.
    There is the mode <Advanced search...> , where You can set
temporary interval, sizes and required attributes for required files.
    Result of work of search (if it will be positive) you will see in
the usual "file" panel with heading Find:  You can consider this panel,
as a "virtual" directory, contents of which is result of search. It is
possible to copy / delete files from it as from usual File panel,
copying in it is inaccessible only. Exit from Find: is made also, as
well as from a usual subdirectory. It is necessary to jump to ".." or
to press [Ctrl-PgUp] for this purpose. Press [Enter] or [Ctrl-PgDn] for
an entrance in a directory, in which there is the current file.
    It is possible to go to an allocated file to another panel with the

2.12 Read File List Ü [Alt-V]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    There is the opportunity of reading of the list of files from a
text file, for example, from files *.?Lo or files.bbs.
    The result is the list of found files finds is located in the
same panel from which command Panel|Read file list was caused.
    This list by a principle of processing as a whole is an analog
of Find: panel provided that objects of search would be names of files.
    The parameters to "on - default" for columns of this panel [Alt-K]
are set with parameters File Find: in
         Options|File Manager|Columns defaults...
    There is the opportunity to use fileboxes:  For this purpose
at editing of files with the descriptions it is necessary
to indicate parameter /FBOX= < dir >,
for example /FBOX=E:\FL\OUT /FBOX=C:\OS2
Further, at reading of this file of the description as a File List
File Boxes will occur.

    The pressing [Enter] on a name of a file or file box moves you to
an suitable directory, as well as Find:

2.13 Temp Drive) Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßß
    It can be considered as the nonexistent drive on which it is
possible to copy the information from different directories, from
different disks - but the information is not copied physically, and it
is only marked that it is on Temp Drive. Then it is possible to conduct
any operations (F3, F4, F5, F6, F8) with these files. Deleting < F8 >,
as well as the moving < F6 >, deletes only image of a file on the Temp
drive, the first copy remains safe. For deleting of a first copy it is
necessary to set
         [X] Remove source files in dialog box "Rename/move".
    The panel of files with Temp Drive has heading TEMP:  The
directories are copied on TEMP: as the files, i.e. in them are
impossible "to enter".

2.14 Directory Branch Ü [Ctrl-H]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    This command serves for opening of all subdirectories of a
current directory in one large directory. Contents of this virtual
directory are all files, which are in a current directory and its
subdirectories. The similar result could achieve, if to make
"Find File" with parameters:
ÉÍ[þ]ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Find File ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
    Functionally the panel Branch: is completely the same as the
Find: panel.

2.15 TDR View Ü
      ßßßßßßßßß
    Dos Navigator supports a format .TDR, used in streamers Arvid
10x0, serving for interfaces of the VHS cassette recorder with IBM PC
AT.  Dos Navigator considers files .TDR, as a specific type of panel,
though the panel TDR: on functional properties is more similar to
the usual file panel. Setup of columns of this panel are made as
setup of all panels:
         Panel|Setup columns [Alt-K] - Setup of the current panel;
         Options|File Manager|Column defaults... - Setup defaults.

    The description of files can be edited also as in a usual
directory with the help of [Alt-Ins]. The editing of the
descriptions is blocked, if a file .TDR has attribute Read-Only.
    All manipulations with files inside .TDR are forbidden. All
operations with these files, except editing of the descriptions and
the operations of search are forbidden too.

    The   search  can  be  made  as  on  a  name  of  a  file  and  its
description.  The  description  is uncertain for entering completely, it
is  enough  to  type  only its part. The search can be made at once with
all  contents  lists,  which are in a current directory. It is necessary
to  establish  an  option  [X]  Search in other TDRs for this purpose in
dialog box "Find File".

 3.2 Delete Ü  [F8]
      ßßßßßßß
    The deleting of files and subdirectories (together with their
contents) in Dos Navigator is made as in other DOS-shells, however,
there are some features:

  - There is the opportunity of deleting files with the
    help of Drag-and-Drop to the basket (Trash), which is set with the
    command ð|Trashcan on/off;
  - If direct access to disk is set
    (Options|Configuration|System setup...
            Direct Access)
    files and, especially, the subdirectories are deleted much faster.
    However this property is characteristic only for MS-DOS version 5.0
or higher.
    In other operating systems setting of Direct Disk Access can
result in failures and other undesirable results.

    Deleting from TEMP: drive deletes only references to deleted file
(a file, naturally, remains).

    Deleting  from  archive  really  results in deleting of a file from
it  (appropriate  archiver  is  started for this purpose). At attempt to
delete non-empty directory Dos Navigator issues the message:

          ÉÍ[þ]ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ Confirm ÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ»

    If simply "automatically" to press [ENTER] anything happen as to
"by - default" the button < No > is chosen.
    In  case,  when  is  chosen  to delete several non-empty directories
and  you  are  sure  that  you  want  to  delete them, it is possible to
press  the  button  <  All  >,  do  not  trouble  yourself with repeated
confirmation.
    If  some  files  are  selected,  and  you should delete only one, it
can be made with the help of [Shift-F8]

 3.3 Print Ü [Ctrl-F9]
      ßßßßßß
    There is the opportunity of background printing of a file
in Dos Navigator . File is loaded in the Print Manager.
Certainly, anybody will not forbid you type" Copy to prn ",
however, we recommend use just File|Print, because:
  - First: files could be in Print Manager already and it works in
    parallel with Dos Navigator's Print Manager, including to
    process of copying. Thus it is possible that simultaneously two
    files will be printed on one printer.
  - Second: it is possible to set options of initial and final
    lines of initialization for Print Manager, that can be useful
    for more convenient printing.

    This concerns and for printing from the text editor.

 3.4 Split/Combine Ü  [Shift-F5]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    It  is  possible  to  break one large file on parts with the help of
Split. Dos Navigator uses whole free disk memory on each diskette.
    The  files  with  extensions  ".d??" appears during splitting (?? is
the number of a disk).
    Dos  Navigator  distinguishes  created  files-fragments  using these
extensions and internal format during combining.
    If  in  splitting  time  at  the  request for the following diskette
Dos  Navigator  sees,  that  it  already  was  one  of  previous, it can
automatically  delete  the  previous split-piece and to write down a new
one instead.
    To  combine  splitted  file  it  is  necessary  to insert a diskette
with the first part of it 'xxxxxxx.D01' and to submit a command
         File|Split/combine...

    Dos   Navigator   will   offer  to  combine  a  file  in  a  current
directory  of  the  next  panel.  Further  it  is  necessary  to  change
diskettes  with  parts  of a splitted file in the same order. Attention:
the assembly is made _ONLY_ from diskettes to the hard disk.
    There are also the additional options in dialog box  "Split/Combine":
ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
³[ ] Verify disk writes    ³
³[ ] Binary splitting only ³ To write down only binary pieces of files.
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ Otherwise in a beginning of each piece the
                             service information is added. The setting
                             of this flag is not necessary, if Combine
                             will be made with the help of Dos Navigator.

    NOTICE:
  - The files, splitted on volumes in by Dos Navigator without
    setting of a flag " Binary splitting only " are restored only by
    Dos Navigator.
  - The files, splitted on volumes in Dos Navigator with setting of
    this flag by a command File|Combine cannot be restored! Make it you
    can with the help of File|Copy... in a mode Append or, using the
    external programs as a MS-DOS command "copy". (copy in1.txt +
    in2.txt out.txt)

 3.5 Make File List Ü  [Alt-L]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    At  fulfillment  of  this  operation  Dos  Navigator  forms  a  text
file,  lines  of  which  are  selected  files on the current file panel.
Creation  .bat  of  a  file  is  possible,  each line of which is formed
proceeding  of  a  line `Action'. If it does not contain macros like !.!
a  name  of  a  file  is  simply added to contents of Action , otherwise
macros is working.

    True  names  of  files  will  be  will  be  saved in the list, if an
option [X] Store path names is set.


 3.6 File View Ü  [F3]
      ßßßßßßßßßß
    The  viewing  of  a  file  can  be  made  with  external or internal
viewer. There are these internal viewers:
  - text         (With an opportunities of Wrap, Dump, Search and etc.)
  - hex          (With an opportunity of binary editing)
  - DBF          (With an opportunity of viewing of ¬¥¬®-fields)
  - archive      (With opportunities like in the file panel)
  - Arvid TDR    (The contents lists of video cassettes of a Arvid streamer)
  - WKZ          (Spreadsheets of Dos Navigator)

    The  viewing  with  external  viewer is carried out for files, whose

    In  essence,  the  viewing  by  an  external  viewer  is the same as
start  of  a  file  on  extension  using  <  F3 > (for convenience). The
note: if is included [X] Internal Viewer in
         Options|Configuration|System setup...,
before  start  of  an  external  viewer  on  a  current file, it will be
scanned  by  Dos  Navigator  for  matching  with  a  format  of internal
viewer.  If  the  match is found out, the internal viewer of this format
will be started.
    If  you  want  to  view  a  file  known  by  Dos  Navigator in other
format  (for  example to view a DBF-file as the text), it is possible to
choose  a  viewer  from  the  menu File|View. Or, if other format - it
text / hexadecimal, can be chosen
         File|View|Alternate view   [Alt-F3]

  Unique exception is UC2: for viewing of which Ultra Compressor II
is required.
    At   realization   of  viewing  for  a  file  of  archive  there  is
"entrance"  in  this  archive  as in a subdirectory. Archives looks like
subdirectories.   An   entrance  in  archive  is  possible  by  pressing
[ENTER] - is set optionally in
         Options|Configuration|File Panel Defaults.
    You can work with archive like with directories.
    Example:  "  Copy  to  ARJ:  DN  " means that selected files will be
compressed in ARJ-archive with the name DN.ARJ

    There are the special commands:
         File|Copy to archive... [Shift-F1]   Add to archive
         File|Extract archive... [Shifr-F2]   Extract from archive

    In   appropriate   dialog   box   (at   making   archive)  desirable
archiver,  but  also  password  and  additional  options  is possible to
choose.  The  choice  of  a compression is made automatically: by choice
Normal\Faster\Maximum.
    It  is  possible  to  unpack,  to view, to delete, to test files and
directories of archive.
    Place   the   cursor   bar   in  a  root  directory  ".."  or  press
[Ctrl-PgUp] for an exit from archive.

    THE  ATTENTION!!!  Dos  Navigator  can only view headings of various
archives.  For  creation  /  work  with these archives you need original
archivers,  which  will  automatically  be started, according to setting
in Options|Archives.
    Press  [Alt-N]  for  editing  options  of  a  current  archiver.  Be
careful  during  setting  up  options of archivers. If the archiver does
not have enough memory at start, it is desirable to set an option

 3.10 Change Current Directory Ü
       ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The  subdirectories  of  a  current  directory  are  marked  by  the
large  letters  and,  as  a rule, separate color, besides at any kind of
sorting,  except  Unsorted,  they  are  located  in  a  beginning of the
list.  Place  the  cursor  bar  on  the necessary subdirectory and press
[Enter]  or  twice  click  on  it  a  mouse for change directory. If you
keep  [Ctrl]  during  moving  on  the panel through arrows there will be
the   automatic   entrance   in  a  directory,  archive  or  file  after
releasing it.
    ".." Or [Ctrl-PgUp] mean exit to parent directory.
    Exit in root directory[Ctrl-\]
    You  can  use  subdirectories  not  only in the usual file managers,
but also in archives.
    There  is  the  opportunity  of  fast  change of a current directory
with bookmarks [Alt-n, (n = 1..9)]
    For   convenience   of   work   it  is  possible  differ  right  and

    Press   [Ctrl-Alt-Shift-n,   (n   =  1..9)]  for  make  bookmark  on
current directory.
    For reception of the list use
         Panel|Quick dirs.... [Alt-Shift-0]

    Change  of  a  directory  during  fast  search  in the file panel on
pressing "\" at the end of typed of a name is possible.
    For  fast  change  of  a current directory click a mouse in the name
of  a  current  directory  in  the  top  framework of the file panel. In
opening modal dialog box you can quickly choose a necessary directory.
    Similar command of the menu:
         Panel|Change directory... [Alt-T]

3.11 Make Directory Ü  [F7]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    For creation of a new directory choose
         File|Make Directory.
    It  is  possible  to  create  new  directories, specifying, which of
them need to be created " on a way ".
    For     example:     you     want     to    create    a    directory
:\MYDIR\MYSUBDIR1\MYSUBDIR2,   but  the  directory  C:\MYDIR  does  not
exist  (however,  as  well  as  its  subdirectori-  es).  There  are  no
problems  -  you  type  C:\MYDIR\MYSUBDIR1\MYSUBDIR2  in a input line of
dialog box " Make Directory " and receive desirable result.
    There  is  the  opportunity  of  creation of several directories for
one operation, using ";" as a divider.
    For   example:   Make   Directory   "1;2;3;4;5"   will  create  five
appropriate directories.

3.12 Count Directory Length Ü  [Alt-G]

the panel.

3.13 Set File Attributes Ü  [Alt-E]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    For setting file attributes there is the command
         File|File Attributes.
    If  there  are  selected  files  on the panel, the attributes can be
set or to be deleted for all of them.
    For directories the setting of attributes can be caused on [F4]
    Date and time of creation can not be changed for them.

3.14 Archive files Ü  [Shift-F1]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    For a making archive of selected files a command serves
         File|Copy to archive...
    You  should  choose  a  type  of  archive from available in the list
"Archive type ".
    All  parameters,  such  as  name  of  a  program  - archiver and its
options,  are  selected  by  Dos  Navigator  automatically  according to
settings in
         Options|Archives >
    The  last  chosen  archiver  is considered as a current archiver and
in  the  following  time at archieving the index of choice automatically
will be set on this type of archive.
    The  parameters  "  of  a  current  archiver  "  can  be edited by a
command
         Options|Archives|Current archiver...  [Alt-N].
    In  a  input  line  " Archive to " a name of archive must be set (by
default  Dos  Navigator  offers as a name of archive a name of a current
directory  or  file).  It  is  not  necessary  to specify extension (Dos
Navigator  automatically  puts  down  extension of archive, according to
its type).
    In  a  input  line  "Password"  the password on archive must be set.
The password is asked once again, to avoid an error during input.
    In  a  input  line  "  Additional  options'  additional options of a
making  archive  are  specified,  which are specific for current process
of  archieving  or  which  cannot  be  indicated  in  options of current
archive
         Options|Archives >

    If   the   archive   with  a  required  name  does  not  exist,  Dos
Navigator  will  create  new  archive. Otherwise the files will be added
in  already  available  archive, and the old files will be automatically
replaced  new  from  among  those,  which  were  selected  for  a making
archive.

3.15 Extract files from archive Ü  [Shift-F2]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    There  is  the  command  for  extraction  of all files from archive,
which is chosen by the cursor bar of the file panel
         File|Extract archive...
    The  files  can  be  placed  in  any directory (similarly to process
of copying of files).

    These options of extracting are available:
 [X] Extract with path names
         If this option is forbidden, all files will be extracted
         in one directory, indicated in a field of input " Extract to ".
 [ ] Test only

    In  a  field  of  input  "Password"  the  password is entered, if it
was used at creation of archive.

    The  note:  If  it  is  necessary  to  take from archive not all but
only  some  files,  it  can  be made of the panel of viewing of archive.
Therefrom  they  simply  "are  copied"  how  as  if  they are in a usual
directory.  Thus  instead  of operation of "copying" Dos Navigator makes
operation " extraction from archive ".


3.16 UU Encode file Ü  [Ctrl-F7]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The   UU-code  is  the  special  format  for  code  conversion  of a
binary file.
    The  files  in  a  UU-format  consist  extremely of printed symbols.
As a rule, the UU-code is used to send files by electronic mail.

    There is a command to UU-encode file:
         File|UU Encode file...
    Parameter  "  Maximum  lines  per  section  "  specifies  a  maximum
number  of  lines  in  each  UU-section.  Each  section  is located in a
separate  file,  the  name  of  which is indicated in a field of input "
Encode  to  ",  and  the  extension  is  formed by imposing of number of
section on standard extension UUE.
    For  example:  the  first  section  will  have  extension  UU1,  and
21-st  will  have  extension U21. If one section is received in all, its
extension will be UUE.


3.17 UU Decode file Ü  [Ctrl-F8]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    There is a command to UU-decode file:
         File|UU Decode file...

    UU-file  can  contain  hashed  in  any  order  of section of several
various  coded  files.  All  these  files  will be taken and placed at a
directory,  which  is  set  in  parameter  "Target  directory". If there
will  be  some  problems  during decoding, connected to correctness of a
processible  UU-file,  Dos  Navigator  will try to take a maximum of the
useful  information,  and  all  met  errors  will be detailed the end of
operation of decoding.

    Extended  start  of  files  is  realized  in  Dos  Navigator. If the
file is not executable, but its extension has the description in
         Options|Extension file edit...,
a package of DOS commands is started.
    It  is  necessary  to  move  the  cursor on the file panel to a name
of  the  file  and to press one of three combinations of keys - [ENTER],
[Shift-ENTER],  [Alt-ENTER]  for  start  this file. User menu is started
after pressing [Alt-ENTER].
    The  note:  [Shift-ENTER],  [Alt-ENTER]  work  also  with executable
files.  For  this  purpose  they  should  be  described,  as well as all
other extensions.

    For  the  description  of  work  with types of files it is necessary
to cause a command

                        ......... <closing symbol>

    '???'  is  the  extension.  The  opening  and closing symbols should
be  "{"  and "}" for Enter, "(" and ")" for Shift-Enter, "[" and "]" for
Alt-Enter.  Use  "!"  for  a  name  of  a  file,  "!.!"  for  name  with
extension,  "!\"  for  its  directory. To indicate a symbol "!", is used
"!!".
    To  indicate  a  symbol  "]",  is  used  "]]",  etc.  Dos  Navigator

 5. ³ Menu Bar º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼

 5.1 Main Menu Ü  [F10]
      ßßßßßßßßßß
     Dos  Navigator  has  multilevel  system  Pull  Down  Menu. Menu bar
can is in the top line of the screen. You can hide it:
         Options|Configuration|Interface...
                  Hide menu bar.
     Press  [F10]  or  move  the  mouse pointer to the necessary element
of  the  menu  and  press  the button for choice from the main menu . If
the  menu  bar  is hidden, move the mouse pointer to the top line of the
screen and press 1-st (left-hand) mouse button - menu will occur.

     To  choose  commands  from  the  menu  you can with the help of the
keyboard:
  1. Press a key [F10]. It makes active the menu bar.
  2. Use arrow keys for choice the menu, which you want to activate.
     Then press [Enter].
     The note: to cancel action, press a key [Esc].
     For   accelerated   choice   of   an  element  of  the  menu  press
     simultaneously  [ALT]  together  with  the first letter of the name
     of this element.
     For  example,  for an  accelerated   call [File] it is necessary to
     press  [ALT-F],  for  an  accelerated  call [ð] it is necessary to
     press [ALT-Space]
  3. For an accelerated call of an element of the submenu rather simply
     to press on the keyboard the allocated letter in this submenu.

     If  a  command  of  the  menu follows with ..., choice of a command
results  in  a  conclusion  of  a dialog box. If there is a painted over
arrow,  this  command  results  to  other  pull  down  menu. The command
without ... or arrow specifies action, executed after its choice.

     Sometimes   the   commands   of  the  menu  are  shown  "dim",  and
anything  does  not  occur  by  choice  of  them.  It  happens, when the
choice  of  a  command  in  the  given  context  is  not meaningful. For
example,   if   there  is  no  selected  block  in  the  editor,  it  is
impossible  to  cut  out,  to  copy or to erase the text, as the editor,
does  not  know  which  part  of the text it is necessary to cut out, to
copy  or  to  erase.  Hence,  the  appropriate  commands  (Cut, Copy and
Clear)  will  be  in the menu of the editor Edit dim. After selection of
the text in the editor these commands can be chosen.

 5.2 User Menu Ü  [F2]
      ßßßßßßßßßß
     Dos  Navigator  lets  to  the user to create the menu for a call of
external  applications  and  DOS  commands.  It  is  stored  in  a  file

checks  up,  whether  the file with such name is in a current directory,
and,  if  not  finds  it,  starts  the menu from a user directory of Dos
Navigator.
     Creation  and  the  editing  of  global  (i.e.  accessible from any
directory) menu of the user is made with the help of a command
         Options|Global menu definition...
     It  is  possible  to  describe  local menu for each directory using
a command
         Options|Local menu definition...
     It is possible to create multilevel menu.
     Switching  between  local  and  global  user  menu  is  possible by
pressing  [F2].  Editing  the user menu is possible by pressing [F4]. If
the  file  with  the  menu  is not found in a current directory, it will
be  looked  in  upper  directories.  If  Dos  Navigator  will  not  find
neither local menu, the global menu will be started automatically.

     User  menu  of  Dos  Navigator has enclosed structure. Each item of
this  menu  begins  by  a  symbol ">", after which level of this item in
hierarchy  of  the  menu  follows.  Further  through a blank the name of
this  item  follows,  in  which  it  is possible to allocate by a symbol
"~"  the  letter,  having  pressed  which,  it is possible to cause this
user  command  without  movement on the menu by arrows. In the following
lines  there  is  the  list  of  DOS commands where the following macros
can act:

  !   - Name of a current file in the active file panel
  $   - Name of a current file in the passive file panel
  .!  - Extension of a current file in the active file panel
  .$  - Extension of a current file in the passive file panel
  !\  - Name of a directory of a current file in the active file panel
  $\  - Name of a directory of a current file in the passive file panel
  !/  - Name of a directory of a current file in the active file panel
        (without "\" in the end)
  $/  - Name of a directory of a current file in the passive file panel
        (without "\")
  !:  - Name of a disk of a current file in the active file panel
  $:  - Name of a disk of a current file in the passive file panel

     These  macros  can  be  used  in  the names of elements of the menu
too.
    %1      - Name of the list of selected files in the active panel
    %2      - Name of the list of selected files in the passive panel
    %3...%9 - User parameters

     The  following  item  of  the  menu begins again with a symbol ">".
The  empty  line  after  heading  of  an  element of the menu means that
divider will be hear instead of the menu item.
     With  the  help  of  a line, which begins with " < " it is possible
to  set  a  line,  which will be introduced at the request of parameters
%3,  %4  etc.  Is thus automatically considered, that it is necessary to
request  these  parameters.  And  if  the  line  begins on " < = ", all,
that goes after it, is considered as parameters by default.
     If  the  item  of  the  menu  begins  with  a double symbol ">", it
starts   in   mode   "Fast   command   execution"  -  thus  settings  of
environment  variables  will  be  set by commands of this menu item will
be  given  to  the  first  copy  of  COMMAND.COM.  For  creation  of the
following  level  of  the  menu  it is necessary to increase number of a
level  of  item  on  1  in comparison with previous one and all elements
of this menu level to write further with this number.

     Here is an example of a user menu file:

         >1 Microsoft ~W~indows
           echo Starting Microsoft Windows...
           Win
        >1
        >1 ~A~idstest
           >2 ~T~est all files in all disks
           Aidstest * /f /g /s /q
           >2 Test ~a~ll disks
           Aidstest * /f
           >2 Test ~c~urrent directory
           Aidstest . /f

     The  note:  Dos  Navigator  does  not support external hot keys for
elements of the menu, including F1.. F10.
     It  is  possible  to  allocate an element of the menu with the help
of ' ~ ~ ' instead.
     For  faster  start  of  some  elements  of  the  menu  use keyboard
macros which are described in section 23.2.

 5.3 Quick Run User Batch Ü
     ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     There  is  the  opportunity  to  start user applications without an
additional  call  of  the user menu on pressing [Ctrl-Shift-Fn] keys:  ,
where  n=1  ..10.  The  structure  of  this  applications is stored in a
file  DN.XRN,  which  is  in  a  system  directory of Dos Navigator. The
description  of  elements  of  this  structure  completely is similar to
the  description  of  items of the user menu. One exception is one level
of  hierarchy  is  supported  only  and  the  elements of this structure
should  not  contain  the names, as items of the user menu. Accordingly,
number  after  a  symbol  "  >  " means not depth of an hierarchy but it
means   key  (F1..  F10),  on  which  start  of  this  element  will  be
activated.
     The  users  of  OS/2  can  use  a specific symbol between " > " and
number  of  an  element  to  specify  to  the  program,  that  the given
element   should   be  started  in  separate  session.  The  symbols  of
sessions are standard:
  > - run foreground Full Screen OS/2 session;
  < - run background Full Screen OS/2 session;
  ] - run foreground Windowed OS/2 session;
  [ - run background Windowed OS/2 session;

 Example:

 ; Ctrl-Shift-F1
 >[1
  cmd
 ; Ctrl-Shift-F2
 >2
  Echo Ctrl-Shift-F2 was pressed.
  pause
 ; Ctrl-Shift-F10
 >10
  Echo Ctrl-Shift-F10 was pressed.
  pause


 5.4 Status Bar Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßß
     The  status  bar  of  Dos  Navigator  is  the  bottom  line  of the
screen. It can be hidden in
         Options\Configuration\Interface...
              'Hide status bar'.
     This  line  reminds  to  you  about  main  commands  and  their hot
keys,  applicable  in  the  given  moment  to an active window, but also
offers  the  brief  explanations  on  some  commands  of  the  menu  and
elements of dialog boxes.
     The  status  bar  reacts  to  pressing  of  [Alt],  [Ctrl], [Shift]
keys  changing  the  list  of  commands. It also reacts to pressing by a
mouse.

 6. ³ Disk Operations º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
     The disks operations are carried out through the menu Disk.

 6.1 Diskette Formatting Ü  [Shift-F7]
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     The  formatting  of  diskettes  (including on non-standard formats)
in Dos Navigator can be carried out in a background mode.
     There   is   the   opportunity  completely  to  set  parameters  of
formatting  in  dialog  box  "  Advanced  format... ".
    ATTENTION!!!  Dos  Navigator  can  format  a  diskette  on a format,
which   it   can   not   read   without  appropriate  drivers  (800.COM,
PU_1700.COM, DRIVER.SYS).

 6.2 Volume Label Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßß
     Sets  a  label  of  a  volume  on a disk. [X] Direct Access must be
specified for this disk in
         Options|Configuration|System setup...

 6.3 Reanimator Ü  [Shift-F6]
      ßßßßßßßßßßß
     There   is  the  built-in  application  for  restoring  of  deleted
files and directories in Dos Navigator
        Disk|Reanimator...
     It  is  also  possible  to  cause  the  start  of  Reanimator twice
clicked a mouse on the Trashcan.

     [X] Direct Access must be specified for this disk in
         Options|Configuration|System setup...

     There  is  the  opportunity  to view deleted files in text, dump or
hexadecimal modes in the Reanimator.
     ATTENTION!!! Not all deleted files can be restored properly.

    Dos Navigator make a prognosis of a restore possibility:
   þ good    -  Chances to restore very good (but the errors are possible!)
   þ average -  Chances to restore average (will be certain errors!)
   þ poor    -  No chances to restore.
     Do  not  despair,  if  it  was not possible to restore deleted file
with the help of Reanimator. Try to make it manually by Disk Editor.

     ATTENTION:  The  restoring  of  directories  is  recommended  to be
used  only  in  extreme  cases,  as  in  case of unsuccessful attempt of
restoring  could  appear  the  cross  references to files in the FAT. It
is  dangerous  because you can lose the most various files on this disk.
Reanimator  prognoses  success  of  restoring,  but  cases are possible,
when  the  information  will  be  partially  destroyed  therefor  it  is
possible  to  restore  a directory, but it's NOT possible to restore its
contents...  Therefore  such  operations  as  restoring  of  directories
(files  too)  are  desirable  for  making not independently but with the
experienced experts who can use the Disk Editor.

 6.4 Disk Editor Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßß
     Small  built-in  Disk  Editor  lets to work with the logic drive on
a  low  level  i.e.  ignoring  its  logic  structure. It is necessary to
include  Direct  Disk  Access  for  this  drive  for this purpose. It is
possible  manually  to  restore  a  deleted file here, to make a dump of
sectors and etc..
     Work  of  Disk  Editor  is  an analog in work with the same product
of   firm   Symantec   from   Norton   Utilities  (within  the  realized
functions). It is possible here:
   - To view a site of a disk (file, cluster, sector) in a
     hexadecimal or text mode, in a kind of a directory or FAT;
   - To edit files and sectors symbol-by-symbol or binary in a
     hexadecimal mode;
   - To copy sites of physical disk space in a file;
   - To edit attributes of files and directories and etc..

After  choice  of  a  directory  there  is the new file manager with the
panel and tree.

     Command Panel|Change directory... [Alt-T]

     If  you  do  not  want  to  open  the new file manager, press [Alt-
T].  The  action  of  this  dialog  box  is  similarly with previous one
except  its  result.  The  working  directory  will  be  replaced in the
current file panel in this case.

 7. ³Text Editor º  [F4] [Alt-F4]
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
     The  window  of  the  text  editor of Dos Navigator is intended for
editing already existing and creation of new text files.

     It  is  possible  to  open several editor windows in Dos Navigator.
Their  number  is  limited  only  by  free  memory. The exchange of data
between  them  is  made  through the same Clipboard. You can edit files,
which  size  is  less  then  amount  of free memory. For the sanction of
use of extended memory it is necessary to set
         Options|Configuration|Editor/Viewer...
                [X] Use EMS memory
                [X] Use XMS memory
     Maximum quantity of edited lines is 32768.
     There is multilevel undo [Alt-BackSpace].
     There  is  a  small,  but pleasant feature of work of the editor of
Dos  Navigator.  The  ruler  appears  in  a  editor  window  of  the  at
pressing  on  2-nd  (right)  button  of  the  mouse.  This  ruler  moves
together  with  the  cursor  of  the mouse within the limits of a window
of the editor.
     There  is  the  sorting  of  lines  for  contents  of  the selected
vertical block
         Block|Sort lines [Alt-T]
     Count  of  a  sum  of  numbers  in  the selected vertical block and
storing it in Clipboard is possible:
         Block|Calculate sum [Alt-Ins]

     Attention!!!  All  settings  of  the  editor vanish with closing of
the  editor  and  do not act on other windows of the text editors. There
is  the  command  of  the  global  menu  to  set  desirable  options "by
default":
         Options|Configuration|Editor/Viewer...
or in a file DN.HGL for any extension.
     There   is   the   opportunity  to  protect  an  edited  file  from
simultaneous  modifying  it  in  different  windows of Dos Navigator, in
different  sessions  of  multitask  systems or on different workstations
in a local network.

 7.3 Blocks Ü
      ßßßßßßß
     The  text  block  is  piece of the text (from one symbol or word up
to  hundreds  lines),  which is selected on the screen. One block can be
selected in a window only in each moment of time.
     There are two main types of blocks:
         () - line blocks,
         () - vertical blocks.
     The switching between them is carried out by pressing [F5]
         Options|Vertical blocks
     It  is  also  possible  to  switch  a type of the block by pressing
of  the  mouse  button  on the block switcher in the bottom framework of
the editor.
     The  mark  of  the  block  can  be  made with the help of a pressed
key  <Shift>,  being  moved  through  the  text  with the help of cursor
arrows.  It  is  also  possible  by moving in the text with pressed 1-st
(left-hand)  mouse  button.  There  are  the special commands for a mark

   an insert in other editor or input line.

* To insert (to copy) the text, contained in Clipboard, press keys
   [Shift + Ins] or choose a command Edit|Paste. The block,
   contained in the buffer, is inserted from current cursor position.
   By work with vertical blocks has significance, whether a mode of an
   insert of the text is set. If it is switched 'on', the text sticks
   after cut of the block, and the text is moved apart according to
   the size of the block after insert of it. If it is switched 'off'
   the text does not vary after cut \ insert of blocks.

* For deleting of the selected text press keys [Ctrl + Del] or
   choose a command Edit|Clear. The selected block disappears
   from the text, and the copy is NOT saved in the Clipboard. The
   unique method of restoring of the removed text consists in a

   cursor, the selection of the block is cancelled.
* If parameter Persistent Blocks is switched on, parameter
   Overwrite Blocks is ignored.
* If parameter Overwrite Block is switched on, and parameter
   Persistent Block is switched off, and you press a key Del or key
   Backspace, whole selected text disappears.
* If parameter Overwrite Block is switched on, and you type the
   letter, the selected block is replaced by the typed letter.
   If you insert the text from Clipboard, whole selected text is
   replaced by the inserted text.
* If parameter Overwrite Block is switched off, and you type the
   letter, the letter is inserted after the selected text.

    Built - in viewer can display the text in three modes:
         - Text;
         - HEX;
         - Dump.
The switching between them is carried out by key [F4].
    It is possible to set a Wrap mode in a text mode ([F2] key).
    It  is  possible  to  edit  a file symbol-by-symbol in a hexadecimal
mode  i.e.  each  symbol  is  edited  separately and it is impossible to
change the size of a file.
    It  is  possible  to  type HEX-code of symbols and directly symbols.
Switching between modes of editing - [Tab].
    Move cursor to the offset from the beginning of a file - [F5]
(does not work in a text mode).
    Pattern search (text or hexadecimal) - [F7]. Search again - [Shift-F7].
    It   is   possible   to   switch   a  range  of  displayed  symbols.
Characters,   whose   HEX-codes  are  outside  of  this  interval  are
displayed by "."
               Allowable intervals (HEX-codes):
     - 00h..FFh  /00..255/ (All symbols);
     - 20h..7Fh  /32..127/ (ASCII-Format);
     - 20h..FFh  /32..255/ (Special symbols are filtered)
    Switching of displayed intervals - [F6]

    The   initial   displacement   in  the  first  column  for  HEX  and
Dump-modes  (horizontal  shift  of  the  text)  can  be changed with the
help  of  [Ctrl-left/right].  It  is possible to carry out shifting text
upwards  /  downwards  or right / left with the help of cursor arrows or
the  mouse.  To  use  mouse  keep  pressed  the button in an appropriate

21. ³ User Interface º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼
     Dos Navigator is programmed with the help of Turbo Vision (C)
Borland International, Inc., so it has all properties, inherent to
this system:
         - Overlapped windows;
         - Popup and pull-down menus;
         - hot keys;
         - dialog boxes;
         - scroll bars and so on
    All  this,  as  well  as  Turbo  Vision, is realized in a text mode.
It  enables  the  user  to  work with the favorite ASCII table, keyboard
layout  and  so  on.  Some  standard combinations of keys (Hot keys) are
redefined,   according   to   specific   of  DOS  shell,  but  also  for
compatibility   with   other   famous   products   in  this  sphere,  in
particular, with Norton Commander (C) Symantec.

    Dos  Navigator  PowerPack,  in  which compilers of resources (dialog
boxes,   menu,   hot   keys),  messages  and  context  help  system  are
included,   is   delivered  separately.  You  can  independently  define
appearance  of  Dos  Navigator  and  its reaction to hot keys, translate
all  messages  to  the  native  language  with  them.  On  its  purchase
address to the regional distributor.

    For  the  more  complete  description  about  the  menu commands and
their  hot  keys  look  in the menu and context help, which is caused on
[F1].  There  are  the  description of main windows of Dos Navigator and
rules of their use.

    You  can  use  the  mouse in all windows of Dos Navigator
(Drag-and-Drop and Turbo Vision standards).

    The  pressing  on  2-nd  (right)  mouse button during fulfillment of
dialog box is similar to pressing on < Enter >.

21.1 Multi-Language support Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The  majority  of  the  messages of Dos Navigator, but also menu and
the  dialog  boxes  are made external resources. It means, that they can
be changed without changes in a code of the program.
    You  can  change  practically  all messages and dialog boxes. Unique
restriction:  it  is  necessary to observe the order of the descriptions
in files of resources.
    The  language  resources  usually  have extension LNG, and resources
of  dialog  boxes  DLG.  Resources, as well as appropriate compilers for
them:  LNGCOMP,  RESCOMP  do  not  present  into  standard Dos Navigator
package.
   It is necessary to remember,
that  changing  of  resources can result in a situation, when instead of
one command will be executed another (probably, absolutely unsafe)!
    It  is  possible  to  use  one  copy of Dos Navigator with different
resources (DNLNG environment).


21.2 Mouse support Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    The    start    DN.COM    with   parameter   /STDMOUSE   disconnects
independent   mouse  support  (there  were  the  problems  in  OS/2  and
Windows  with  it),  however  it  can  result  incorrect work in 132x25,
132x50,  etc.  video  modes.  You  have to set this mode too, if you use
non-standard  (virtual  graphic)  mouse  driver. The note: it can be set
in options:
         Options|Configuration|Mouse... [X] Standard cursor.

21.3 Setup Colors Ü
      ßßßßßßßßßßßßß
    Various    windows   and   their   elements   for   convenience   of
representation  are  allocated  by  various colors. You can set up these
colors as you like.
         Options|Colors...
    To  set  up  color  of  a certain element, it is necessary to choose
group  of  windows,  which possesses this element, and an element in the
appropriate  list  from  the  right. The setup of colors is made through
the    special    indexes   of   colors,   which   differ   for   color,
black-and-white   and   monochrome   monitors.   To  on  -  default  Dos
Navigator  automatically  checks  up and establishes a type of the video
adapter.   That   it   was   possible   to   work   with  other:  color,
black-and-white  or  monochrome  palette of colors, this check should be
switched off:
         Options|Configuration|Startup...|Detect video mode.
    The  type  of  the  adapter  is  chosen  by  appropriate  buttons in
dialog box Options|Colors...

    The  installed  colors  and  type  of  the monitor are automatically
saved  in  a  file of a configuration, but there is also the opportunity
to save set - up colors in an external palette and to restore them from
         Options|Store\Load palette.
    There  is  the  opportunity  to  restore " colors to on - default ".
It  is  necessary  to  allow  [X] Default colors set and to press one of
buttons < Color >, < B/W >, < Mono > for this purpose.

     It is possible to set up a color palette < VGA palette > for
VGA-compatible video adapters.
         Options|Configuration|System setup|VGA palette
              Enable palette usage.
If you want, that before start of the external programs Dos Navigator
should restore a standard palette of colors, it is necessary to set
         Options|Configuration|System setup|VGA palette
              Reset palette on execute
If you want, that before exit Dos Navigator should restore a standard
palette of colors, it is necessary to set
         Options|Configuration|System setup|VGA palette
              Reset palette on exit

    It  is  possible  to  allow  mixing of RGB-colors for VGA-compatible
monitors  for  black-and-white  and monochrome monitors, thus, the setup
of  colors  of  a  VGA-palette  is  made  by change of gradation of grey
color.

    You can store current Colors to the external palette.
         Options|Store palette

22. ³ Navigator Link º
    ÔÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼


  Navigator Link allows to access remote computer by a common file panel.
The following features are implemented: Create/Remove directories,
Copy, View and Erase files.

  There is nothing misterious about it: just connect your computers, make
apropriate changes in Options|Configuration|Communications... (at least
make sure that your computers will work at the same speed and OK with
CTS/RTS). DN does not operate with Master/Slave mentions - both linked
computers have the same rights. After you got the message about start of
Link, if you try to change drive letter with Alt-C or Alt-F1/F2,
you will see LINK: addition at the end of the drive box as a submenu with
drive letters from remote drive. To work with a remote drive, just select
the drive from LINK submenu and enjoy!

  Hint: you can even use dial-up connection - just make your modems
connected with the terminal, close the terminal and start the Link.

  Navigator Link uses its own communication protocol, developed by RIT.
Advantages:

 - block streaming mode:
     Navigator Link works seamlessly in server/slave mode and doesn't take
     full CPU time during link session. It is also possible to work fine
     via packet transport protocols (ipx/spx, tcp/ip) and other hardware
     (parrallel port) via FOSSIL interface.
 - bi-directional mode and true full duplex:
     Both machines linked by DN have equal rights on each other's drives,
     and both can work with remote simultaneously.
 - advanced errror correction:
     Navigator Link uses double-level selective reject method, so it works
     even on high-noise lines.
 - real-time data compression:
     Link allows to transfer text files and directory data twice faster
     on the same line. The compression works more efficient than modems'
     internal compression methods.

              loaded from system directory (DN environment variable).
 DNLNG      - String to be added to name of resource files(DN*.LNG & DN*.DLG).
