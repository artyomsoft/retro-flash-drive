                      DOS Navigator - overview

1.  File panel:
   - under file panel understands any panel with any list of files:
     The panel with list of found files, temp drive, archive  and
     usual list of files of directory. Any list is displayed as a
     directory, therefore the appearance at Archive view and Temporary drive
     coincide accurately to information part.
   - Drag-and-Drop ideology.
   - works with files and subdirectories - copy, move, delete etc.
     - copy/move:
        - is used XMS/EMS;
        - check for free disk space (optionally);
        - verifying disk writing (optionally);
        - the possibility to append files to already existing files ( even if
          moving in space of one disk ) is present;
        - if destination of Copy is TEMP: files will be copied on TEMP drive
          of the disk.
     - creation of file-list of selected files. You may create a batch file,
       each line of it is outcoming from string `Action' - if it doesn't

       contain any name macros (i.e. !.!, !), then file name will be simply
       added to end of Action string, otherwise macros will be proceed.
     - managing of printing of files.
     - view/edit of file can be as external, as internal. These viewers
        are: text/hex/dump, .dbf with opportunity viewing of memo-fields,
        archive viewing, .tdr;
     - it is possible to split/combine of long files on parts.
     - it is possible to uuencode/uudecode files.
     - when erasing files, if "Direct disk access" option set on,
       erasing files will speed up.
   - Archive processing:
     - 17 different archive types support:
          ARC - Arc (C) NoGate Consulting
          ARJ - ARJ (C) Robert K. Jung

          ZIP - PKZIP (C) PKWARE Inc.
          ZOO - Zoo (C) Rahul Dhesi

     - you can enter an archive such as an usually directory (optionally)
     - if destination of Copy/Move is <archive descriptor>:<archive name>
       the files will be copied/moved into desired archive.
       Archive descriptor can be: ARC, ARJ, BSA, BS2, CHZ, HA, HAP, HYP, LHA,
        SQZ, ZIP, ZOO, HPK, RAR, LIM, UC2.
     - it is possible to unpack, to view, to erase, to test selected files
       or subdirectories from archive.
   - when comparing of two panels it is possible to indicate criterions
       of comparing (date, size, attributes).
   - visualization of list of files:
     - view of list of files in catalogues with use of file of
       descriptions ( if such is present in given subdirectory - as 4DOS Dir,
       if finds the file descript.ion ). The names of files with descriptions
       are set in filter in File Panel defaults. Column Setup of each panel is
       allowed. You can copy, move, edit and create file descriptions.
     - according to source of list the heading of panel - "Find: *.qqp ",
       "TEMP:", "ARJ:DN2-25.ARJ", "C:\" etc. And information below of list
       (for Find: and TEMP: afterwards information about current file
       its catalogue, for archives - packed size and compression ratio)
     - possible the file highlight by different colors in dependencies
       on type ( are possible 3 standard type - directories, executable files
       (EXE, COM, BAT, BTM and CMD) and archives and five user defined types,
       which can be defined by user with help of extension file -
       Options|File Manager|Highlight groups).
     - files are possible to sort not only on standard (i.e. name, ext, size
       etc.), but also on colors if highlight option is set on.
     - you can put executable files and archives in head of file panel list.
     - it is possible to establish mode of conclusion of list - not only
       Full/Brief - to show whether size, date, time ( for Find: and TEMP:
       the way, for archives - packed size and compression ratio)
     - to show whether in info pane information about marked files, about
       all files of list, about free location on disk ( only for usual lists
       of files of catalogue ).
     - installation multiple filter for file list - for example:
       "*.exe; *.pas; *.tpu ".
   - Point-and-shoot (association to run files in dependence of its type):
     - the batch file (instead of one command DOS) is started.
     - file is possible to process on several to key combinations -
       <ENTER>, <Shift-ENTER>, <Alt-ENTER>. On < Alt-ENTER > user menu
       associated for this extension will be started.
     - the number of extension is unlimited.

2. User menu:
     - it is possible to multiply menu nesting. Unfortunately, that large menu
       of user it is possible to reduce only by use of enclosure.
     - after a menu selection the batch file is started. You can use different
       macros allows processing with current and passive panel of File Manager.
3. Work with disks:
    - edit of label of volume on disk ( on network disks it is not
      executed, unfortunately )
    - restoring of erased files
    - floppy disk formatting
    - disk editing.
4. File editor:
    - multi-level undo
    - block operations uses Clipboard.
    - streamed and vertical block
    - text formatting
5. Calculator:
    - it is possible to calculate formulas
    - hexadecimal, octal, binary and decimal operations
    - common Clipboard with editor.
6. Spreadsheet:
    - the function evaluation is possible: SUM, MUL, IF, sin, cos, tg, ctg,
      arctg, sqr, sqrt, ln, lg, sign, rad, grad
    - it is possible export in text file.
7. Terminal:
    - emulation ANSI, AVATAR, TTY
    - protocols: XModem, YModem, ZModem, Kermit - works in background
    - works in background
    - phone book
8. System information:
    - it is possible to get information about your machine ( type, CPU,
      co-processor, disks, ports, OS version, Conventional/Extended/EMS
      memory sizes, CPU speed)
    - information about TSR programs, system areas and loaded drivers.
    - standard information about current disk, catalogue, volume label,
      free memory size: User, DN, XMS, EMS.
9. Game - Tetris/Pentix
10. Extended text modes support ( type 132å60, 100x25 etc. ).
    Be sure that 'Standard cursor' in Mouse Setup is set off because many
    mouse drivers do not support extended video modes (I think only OS/2
    mouse driver works correctly).
11. Advanced file search. It is possible to search for files by filter
    ( e.g. *.bak;*.$$$;*.tmp ), by text string, by date, size and attributes.
    In addition, File Find works in background (i.e. you can switch to
    another window while search processing)
12. It is possible to work with file lists and create TEMP: drive
    ( usual file list, but you can include files with different location)
    You can copy, move, view etc. files from these lists.
13. Working with keyboard macros:
         Shift + Alt + n - record  ( 1-9 ) / the end of record
         Ctrl + Alt + n - play macro n
14. Is possible the task group of commands for batch  processing in command
    line - they must be separated  by '||'
15. OS/2 v2.10 support - you may start OS/2 or DOS application from DN in
    separated session. Also OS/2 command prompt mode is available.
16. CD-ROM player working with MSCDEX.EXE (or VCDROM.SYS under OS/2).
17. Arvid streamer board support.
18. Navigator Link
