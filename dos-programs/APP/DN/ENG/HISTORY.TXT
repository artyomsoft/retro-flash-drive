   Global
    ßßßßßß

[!] DN is now using extended (AT) keyboard so this version is not possible
      to run on old machines...

[+] File|Unpack diskette images (Ctrl-I).

[+] "Do not kill descriptions" option added to Options|File Manager|Setup
      dialog box. It's now possible to control whenever the descritions

      the descripted panel elements (files/directories) are removed by
      Erase/Move operation.

[+] Shift-Enter works on TEMP/List panels as well as on Find one.

[+] Seconds are now used in time comparing, also DN would not be confused
      with dates in 21'th sectury.

[+] Added Ctrl+R hotkey for re-reading tree.

[+] Del key for removing directories from Tree Panel (if appropriate option
    is set).

[*] It is now possible to call Directory Tree dialogue from Archive/Find/

[*] Directories history can be obtained also from archive/find/temp drive
      panel.

[-] "Long Descriptons" in info panel disappeared after rereading (Ctrl-L) or
      changing "Columns Setup" (Alt-K) or "Description Mode" (Ctrl-K).

[-] Long descriptions are taken considerably to contens of Options|
      File Manager|Setup field, unlike 'files.bbs', hardcoded into previous
      versions.

[-] File manager did not operate huge numbers (>2^31) - now fixed due to
      large drives and archives/TDRs.

[-] Confirmation about launching AUTOEXEC.BAT no more asked from FileFind
      panel.

[-] DN could not operate with files, which has percent characters
      in its names - bug in earlier versions took these characters as
      string format specifiers.

[-] Fixed bug with reading empty root directories (e.g. formatted diskettes).
      In some cases it could corrupt the heap.

[-] Fixed bugs, caused system crashes and memory losses of 'Change Directory'
      Tree Dialog (Alt-T).

[-] Bug with dragging files with tilda characters in the name.

    file.


   Miscellaneous
    ßßßßßßßßßßßßß

[+] Long time operations (loading files for edit, scanning drive trees,
      directory branching and sizing) can be cancelled by pressing ESC key.

[+] 'Multilanguage' critical errors.

[+] Options|Configuration|Startup|TimeSlicing Options
      [ ] DOS Idle (Int28)     Ä  periodically returns to DOS remainings of
           time intervals by calling Int28. This option alone is compatible
           with timeslicing mechanism of previous versions of DN.
      [ ] Sleep when inactive  Ä  when it is nothing to do, and no key
           pressed during several seconds, DN falls asleep.

[+] Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Flush disk buffers - if set on,
      DN forces File System Manager to flush immediately all write-back
      buffers after copying/erasing files

[+] Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Advanced copy
      [ ] When this options is set off, DN doesn't use EMS/XMS memory
            for filecopy buffering (the only conventional - all amount).
            It always copies only one file at a time - doesnt open
            a next file for reading before finished writing the current one.

[+] "Autodetermine" checkbox in Make List File dialog. If this option is set
      "on", every call to this dialog will make to determine the necessaty
      of paths (and set "Store path names in list files" automatically).
      Considered path names are useful only on Branch/Find/Temp-Drives,
      instead of a similar diskdrive panel. If "Autodetermine" option is set
      "off", the value of "Store path names" checkbox is not set
      automatically when calling dialog, but is preserving since last call.

[+] Screen Grabber now handles PgUp/PgDn and Home/End keys. Movement /
      resizement scale is also affected by Ctrl key.

[*] Semicolon is used as comment character in .MNU file.

[*] Improved speed of copying files.

[*] Empty field of "Temporary Directory" (Options|Configuration|System Setup)
      is treated as a value of %TEMP% (or %TMP%) environment variable.

[*] DN doesn't allocate more than 8 MB RAM for copy buffer to avoid
      unnecessary virtual memory swapping under multitasking envoronment.

[*] Branch, FileFind and Archive Viewers are now able to use
      EMS/XMS/SwapFiles, so their file storage possibities are expanded.

[*] Workaround for a bug of OS2 Warp 4 (Merlin) gammas - turn off
      Options|Configuration|System Setup|Options|Advanced copy - it will slow
      down copying and erasing, but will prevent system traps while erasing
      subdirectories.

[*] Windows 95 doesn't try to switch windowed session to full screen
      every time when DN examines VESA-BIOS presence on startup.

[*] Validating file creation date in 'Change File Attributes' dialog.

[*] When Screen Mode is changed, the clock is now properly positioned.

[*] Disk Formatter: Volume Label length is now correct (11 characters).

[*] Formatter and File Search windows are now shown in Window Manager.

[-] Fixed bugs with displaying copy gauges on large files (>~30Mb).

[-] Improved speed of erasing files. Earlier were doing it not so fast
      because of always trying to clear ReadOnly attribute before erasing
      file, even if this flag was absent.

[-] Value of "Options|Configuration|System Setup|Disable XMS/EMS usage"
      checkbox have been ignored in earlier versions - now fixed.

[-] Fixed calculator's "power" operation.

[-] Bugs with numbers beginning with '.' in Calculator and Spreadsheet.

[-] Fixed traps, appeared in calculator when character data was passed to
      function's argument, e.g. "EXP(A)".

[-] After modifying spreadsheets (WKZ) panel still left unrefreshed until
      pressing Ctrl-R.

[-] Now now DN asks to overwrite before copying (F5/F6) read-only files
      too - bug in earlier versions overwrote them without any confirmation,
      unlike normal files.

[-] Button width in message boxes now corresponds to caption width to prevent
      wrapping in international builds.

[-] Reanimator and Environment editor windows did not answered on Ctrl-F5
      keyboard combination (Size/Move Window command).

[-] "!\" and "!/" extension specifiers are now parsed normally, without
      a last character loss.

[-] Answering 'Cancel' on confirmation to save modified file before
      running external program or archive swapping, caused crash. Now fixed.

[-] When the amount of available extended/expanded memory was not
      enough to allocate overlays completly, DN halted with fatal error. Now
      in this case it leaves overlays on disk, but uses extended/expanded
      memory for other needs.

[-] Fixed problems with Advanced Format Dialog Box disposing.

[-] Terminal window resizing painted background with an invalid color.

[-] Redial timeout in autodialer is now working.

[-] Scrollback buffer overflow did not handled correctly and could
      hang the system.

[-] Printer Setup | Ending string value was ignored, it was always taken from
      Initial string.

[-] DN could not change the descriptions of TDR's with ReadOnly attribute,
      which is default for this type of files.

[-] Fixed problems, caused memory losses on TDR processing.

[-] Fixed displaying of tilda character in file name of copy dialog boxes.



   Navigator Link
    ßßßßßßßßßßßßßß

[!] Navigator Link allows to access remote computer by a common file panel.
    The following features are implemented: Create/Remove directories,
    Copy, View and Erase files.

    Navigator Link uses its own communication protocol, a kind of Niagara(tm)
    block transfer protocol, developed by RIT.

    Advantages:

    - block streaming mode:
        Navigator Link works seamlessly in server/slave mode and doesn't take
        full CPU time during link session. Using of FOSSIL interface allows
        you to work via packet transport protocols (ipx/spx, tcp/ip) and other 
        hardware (parallel port), if you have an appropriate FOSSIL driver.
        We left FOSSIL-driver writing for third-parties yet...
    - bi-directional mode and true full duplex:
        Both machines linked by DN have equal rights on each other's drives,
        and both can work with remote simultaneously.
    - advanced errror correction:
        Navigator Link uses double-level selective reject method, so it works
        even on high-noise lines.
    - real-time data compression:
        Link allows to transfer text files and directory data twice faster
        on the same line. The compression works more efficient than modems'
        internal compression methods.
