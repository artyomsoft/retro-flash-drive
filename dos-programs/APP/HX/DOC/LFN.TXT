 Support of long filenames (LFN)

 1. Installing LFN for DOS
 
 Filenames exceeding the old DOS 8.3 format are not supported by native
 DOS versions. To add support for LFN additional software is required,
 the best is DOSLFN, which may be downloaded from
   
     http://adoxa.cjb.net                                           or
     http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/~heha/hs_freeware/doslfn.zip.

 As default, LFN will be enabled for FAT file systems only, if you want
 to have LFN for CDROMs, you must add switch "-c+" when installing DOSLFN.

 For DOSEMU, there is an option to enable LFN as well, but is most likely
 works for DOSEMU versions >= 1.3 only (now seems to be default for version 
 1.3.3). Activating LFN for CDROMs may be a bit tricky in DOSEMU, but
 should work for versions > 1.3.3 without external software (DOSLFN).


 2. Disabling LFN in HDPMI
 
 Some old DOS versions may cause problems if no LFN driver is installed but
 a program tries to use LFN functions. That's because the DOS call returns
 with Carry flag cleared, indicating the function call was successful, but
 in fact it failed. For such constellations HDPMI can be told to disable
 its LFN support and return an error to the program instead. There is a
 good chance that the program will then fall back to use the non-LFN DOS
 file functions. Disabling LFN in HDPMI is done by setting environment
 variable HDPMI=128.
