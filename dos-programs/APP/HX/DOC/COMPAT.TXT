  [1]: requires LFN support to be installed. View Unsupp\LFN.txt for
       more details about how to activate this support for plain DOS.

  [2]: these apps may require a lot of file handles, which is a scarce
       resource in native DOS (set by entry FILES= in CONFIG.SYS, max.
       value is 255). In case an app exceeds this limitation, you may
       get strange error messages, so to avoid problems I would suggest
       to set at least FILES=80.

  [3]: needs HX GUI.

  [4]: requires a packet driver to be installed.

  [5]: needs a DOS ASPI driver and WNASPI32.DLL from Windows 9x.
       View Doc\DKRNL32.TXT for details about HX's ASPI support.

  [6]: requires OPENGL32.DLL (+GLU32.DLL) from Windows 9x.

  [7]: environment variable DPMILDR=16 must be set.

  [8]: to start the binary it might be needed to enter
       "dpmild32 -g <binary_name>".

  [9]: environment variables HDPMI=32, DPMILDR=8 must be set (see B).

  Furthermore, some of the programs in this list may need MS C runtime dlls 
  (MSVCRT.DLL, MSVCRx0.DLL, CRTDLL.DLL).


  B. Nested Execution of Win32 Apps in DOS

   Nested execution of Win32 apps with HX may require some additional
  configuration steps. This is because very often the apps cannot share
  an address space due to missing relocation information in the binaries,
  which are needed to load them at any address. The HX tools provide the
  ability for multiple address spaces, but this feature has to be made
  deliberately active by setting both of these environment variables:

    SET HDPMI=32
    SET DPMILDR=8

  The first setting will instruct HX's DPMI host HDPMI to supply each client
  with its own address space, the second instructs HX's PE loader DPMILD32
  to not try to load more than one application in the current client.


  If multiple address spaces are not supported by the DPMI host, but a
  version of the calling app is available *with* relocation info, one can
  possibly rebase this first app by utility REBASE.EXE (Win32 SDK). Thus
  the standard image base address 400000h remains free for the called app.

  Please note that it is sometimes not obvious that a nested execution
  takes place. MS LIB.EXE (COFF), for example, uses LINK.EXE for the
  real work. The same is true for EDITBIN and DUMPBIN. As well, MS LINK
  (COFF) will launch an instance of itself (!) if an export file has to
  be build.

  DosEmu regretably doesn't support multiple address spaces. Setting
  DPMILDR=8 will be useless in this environment.
