 Special DPMILD32 version

 Please note: this version is no longer the one with LFN support!!!
 This has changed since HXRT v1.99.

 The version of DPMILD32 found in this directory will *not* use the LFN
 versions of DOS file open functions. It should only be used if the
 version in BIN (which will use LFN) doesn't work or causes problems.
