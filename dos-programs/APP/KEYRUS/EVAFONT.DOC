   Overview
   ________

      EVAfont utility  provides you with ability to customize your EGA
   or VGA  text fonts. These very short notes will help you to get the
   job done.
      Bit-mapped font is a binary representation of characters you see
   on the  computer screen.  And, unless  you're a  hexadecimal number
   cruncher, it's  a little  bit tricky to create or modify such fonts
   without the  appropriate tools.  That's what  EVAfont was developed
   for.
      The internal  structure of  a bit-mapped  font is  quite simple:
   each row  of dots  is represented  with the  bits of a single byte,
   thus each  character in  a bit-mapped  format is  composed of 'row'
   bytes, and complete font length is 256 x 'rows-in-character' bytes.
      EVAfont can  handle fonts  of size  8x8, 8x14  and 8x16  pixels,
   exactly to  match needs for CGA, EGA and VGA video cards. Fonts are
   stored in  the files  (usually with  extension .FNT) with length of
   2048, 3584  and 4096 bytes respectively. In most cases you load the
   font from  disk or  grab it from the screen, then modify it to your
   taste, and  when you  see the  font you like, single key press will
   produce executable  file with  .COM extension. If you choose it for
   everyday use,  simply run  this file from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to
   make driver active every time your computer boots up.
      
      
      
   Starting EVAfont
   ________________
      
      Command line to start EVAfont looks something like that:
      
      EVAFONT [filename][/C][/M][/K][/A]
      
      Options are:
         
         filename - optional font file name to load immediately upon
                    start. If omitted, on EGA or VGA system, EVAfont
                    picks up current screen font from video RAM
                    (unless you specify an /A switch).
         /C       - force color mode.
         /M       - force monochrome mode.
         /K       - disable Microsoft mouse.
         /A       - use INT 10h subfunction User Alpha Load instead of
                    direct video RAM font update.
         
      Specify /C  or /M  switches if  you want  to override  automatic
   color selection.  If omitted,  EVAfont uses color palette for color
   monitors and black-and-white for monochrome.
      Disable mouse operations using /K switch. This is useful only if
   your mouse driver initially responds as Microsoft Mouse Driver, but
   then behaves not fully compatible.
      Use /A  switch if you feel that EVAfont gets into trouble during
   direct  read/write   operations  with   text   fonts   video   RAM.
   Usually machine hangs up, screen flashes etc. Be aware that in this
   case your EGA or VGA card is not register-level compatible with Big
   Blue's one.
      
      
      
   Mouse hints
   ___________
   
      You have  full  control  over  EVAfont  functions  using  either
   keyboard or  Microsoft  compatible  mouse.  Left  and  right  mouse
   buttons acts  exactly like  <Enter> and <Escape> keys respectively.
   Dragging mouse  (moving while  holding down  either button) effects
   like Shift + arrow keys combination.
      
      
      
   Font files
   __________
   
      For your convenience there are several font files on the
   diskette:
         
         CGA!FONT.FNT  - 8x8 font, (great for 43/50 line modes).
         EGAIBMAT.FNT  - standard IBM EGA 8x14 font.
         EGARFONT.FNT  - enlarged 8x14 font, Russian characters.
         EGA!FONT.FNT  - enlarged 8x14 font, Helvetica & Russian
                         characters.
         VGAPS260.FNT  - standard IBM VGA 8x16 font.
         VGARFONT.FNT  - VGA 8x16 font, Russian characters.
         VGA!FONT.FNT  - VGA 8x16 font, Helvetica & Russian
                         characters.
         
      
      
      
   PUTFONT utility:
   __________________________
      
      The new utility is included in the package with version 2.03. It
   is intended for use with previously loaded screen drivers produced
   with EVAfont and allows you update fonts on-the-fly without loading
   new copy of the driver and wasting you extremely expensive RAM.
